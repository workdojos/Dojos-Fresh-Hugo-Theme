Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign to promote your new business as a CFO in the finance industry:

Instagram: Create a series of visually appealing posts featuring quotes, tips, and advice related to finance and leadership. Use hashtags like #financialadvice #financialleadership #cfo to reach a wider audience.

Twitter: Share industry news and updates, as well as your own thoughts and insights on finance and leadership. Use hashtags like #financeindustry #cfo #financialmanagement to reach a relevant audience.

YouTube: Create a series of educational videos on finance and leadership topics. These could include interviews with other industry experts, tutorials on financial concepts, or tips for success in the finance industry.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring infographics, charts, and other visual content related to finance and leadership. Use relevant keywords and hashtags to make your content discoverable by potential followers.

Overall, the key to a successful social media campaign is to create engaging, relevant content that resonates with your target audience. By consistently posting high-quality content and engaging with your followers, you can effectively promote your new business and increase brand awareness in the finance industry.

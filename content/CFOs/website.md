As a web design consultant, I would recommend considering the use of open-source technology to build your business website for several reasons.

First, using open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website. You can access and modify the source code of the platform, allowing you to tailor the website to your specific needs and goals. This can be especially beneficial for a company in the finance industry, as you may have specific requirements for data security and privacy that can be more easily addressed with the ability to modify the source code.

Additionally, using open-source technology can be cost-effective as it often does not require licensing fees. This can be especially beneficial for smaller businesses or those with limited budgets.

There are many popular open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other applications that can be used to create a great user experience and be deployed on your own server. Some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal for web builders, and Gatsby and Jekyll for static-site generators.

While there are many benefits to using open-source technology, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks as well. One potential downside is that it may require more technical knowledge and resources to set up and maintain an open-source website, as you will be responsible for managing updates and security yourself. However, there are many resources available to help with this process, and it can be worth the investment for the flexibility and customization that open-source technology allows.

In conclusion, using open-source technology to build your business website can be a great option for flexibility, customization, and cost-effectiveness. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons and determine if it is the right fit for your company's needs and goals.

I have researched and found the following resources and technologists that might be helpful:

Resources:

1.  Eritrea Open Source Association - a non-profit organization that promotes the use of open-source software in Eritrea.
    
2.  Eritrea Software Freedom Day - an annual event that celebrates open-source software and its benefits.
    
3.  Eritrean Open Data - a platform that provides access to open data and promotes its use for development.
    
4.  Eritrea Open GIS - an open-source geographic information system for Eritrea.
    
5.  OpenStreetMap Eritrea - a collaborative project to create a free and open map of Eritrea.
    

Notable Technologists:

1.  Amanuel Ghebreyesus - an Eritrean computer scientist and software engineer who has worked for major tech companies such as Google and Apple.
    
2.  Aklilu Lemma - a renowned microbiologist and immunologist who co-discovered ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasitic diseases.
    
3.  Yemane Baria - a musician and songwriter who was known for incorporating technology into his music-making process.
    
4.  Berhane Hewan - a software developer who co-founded Eritrea's first tech startup, Asmara-Online.
    
5.  Ahmed Saleh - a computer scientist who co-founded Asmara-Online and worked on various open-source software projects.
    

Overall, there is limited information available about open-source tech in Eritrea. However, the resources and notable technologists mentioned above could be a good starting point for further exploration.

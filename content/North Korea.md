Learning about open-source technology in North Korea can be a challenging task, given the country's isolation and limited access to information. However, here are some resources that can help you to start exploring this topic:

1.  The North Korean Technology Forum: This online forum provides a platform for North Korean technologists and enthusiasts to share information and discuss open-source projects. You can find threads on various topics, such as programming languages, operating systems, and software development tools.
    
2.  The North Korea Tech blog: This blog is run by Martyn Williams, a journalist who has been covering North Korea's technology sector for many years. The blog covers a wide range of topics, including open-source software and hardware, and features interviews with North Korean technologists.

They offer courses in computer science, electrical engineering, and other related fields. Although the university is not open to the public, they have released some information on their website.
    

Some notable technologists from North Korea throughout history include:

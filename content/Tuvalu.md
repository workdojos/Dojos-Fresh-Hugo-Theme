As an AI language model, I do not have access to information about technologists in Tuvalu throughout history, but I can provide some resources with links to learn more about open-source technology in Tuvalu.

1.  The Tuvalu Internet Community: This website is an online hub for the Tuvalu community and provides information on various aspects of technology, including open-source technology. It also offers resources on how to connect with the Tuvalu tech community, upcoming events, and news about the local tech scene.
    
2.  The Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat: This organization has a division that focuses on ICT and provides resources on open-source technology and its applications in the Pacific region. They also organize workshops and training sessions for ICT professionals in the Pacific.
    
3.  The Pacific Island Health Officers' Association (PIHOA): PIHOA provides technical assistance to Pacific Island Countries (PICs) to improve their public health systems, and open-source technology is one of the areas they focus on. They provide training and support to health professionals in the Pacific region on open-source health information systems.
    
4.  The Pacific Community (SPC): SPC is a regional organization that provides technical assistance and support to Pacific Island Countries in various sectors, including ICT. They have a division that focuses on information management and provide resources on open-source technology and its applications.
    

In addition to these resources, you can also check out online forums and social media groups dedicated to open-source technology, including GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Reddit. Connecting with other open-source technology enthusiasts from Tuvalu can also help you learn more about the local tech scene and notable technologists.

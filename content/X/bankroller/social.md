Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign to promote your new business as a bankroller:

Instagram: Create visually appealing posts featuring images of your business, your team, and the money lending process. Use relevant hashtags such as #bankroller, #moneylending, and #finance to attract potential customers. Use Instagram stories to showcase behind-the-scenes moments and give a personal touch to your business.

Twitter: Tweet about your business, your services, and any updates or promotions you have. Engage with other finance-related accounts and retweet their content to expand your reach. Use Twitter polls to ask your followers for their opinions and create a sense of community.

YouTube: Create a YouTube channel and post videos explaining your business, how it works, and the benefits of using your services. You can also post success stories from satisfied customers to show the value of your services.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring images and ideas related to money lending, finance, and your business. Use relevant keywords in your board titles and descriptions to attract potential customers. Collaborate with other finance-related accounts to expand your reach.

As the social media manager for your brewpub organization, I would suggest the following strategies:

Twitter:
Tweet regularly about new beers, events, and specials at the brewpub
Use hashtags relevant to the brewpub industry, such as #brewpub, #craftbeer, and #beertasting
Engage with other users in the brewpub industry by retweeting, commenting, and participating in Twitter chats
Share behind-the-scenes content and stories from the brewpub to give followers a more personal look at the organization
Instagram:
Utilize visually appealing content, such as photos and videos of your brewpub, beers, and events
Use relevant hashtags and tag other users and brands in your posts to increase visibility and reach
Collaborate with other Instagram users and brands in the brewpub industry through co-branded content and giveaways
Pinterest:
Create boards focused on beer, brewing, and brewpub-themed content
Pin images of your brewpub, beers, and events to relevant boards
Use Pinterest analytics to track engagement and success of your pins
Collaborate with other users and brands in the brewpub industry by repinning and commenting on their content.

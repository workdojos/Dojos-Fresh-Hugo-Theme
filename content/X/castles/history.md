The word "castle" is thought to have originated from the Latin word "castellum", which means "fortress" or "fortified place". It is believed that this word was introduced to the English language during the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century. The word has remained relatively unchanged in its meaning over time, and still refers to a large, fortified building or residence, often owned by a noble or royal family.

The word "owner" is derived from the Old English word "agana", which means "possessor" or "proprietor". The word has remained unchanged in its meaning since its introduction to the English language, and still refers to someone who owns or possesses something.

In terms of the phrase "castle owner", it simply refers to someone who owns a castle. This could be a noble or royal family, or it could be an individual who has purchased a castle as a residence or for other purposes. The castle owner would have had control over the castle and all of its lands and resources.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology is typically free to use and modify, which can greatly reduce the costs associated with building a website. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses or organizations like a committee working in the self-governance industry that may have limited resources.

Second, open-source technology is often more flexible and customizable than proprietary options. This means you have the ability to tailor the website to your specific needs and goals, rather than being limited by the constraints of a pre-built platform.

Finally, open-source technology often has a strong community of developers and users who are constantly working to improve and update the software. This means you can benefit from the collective knowledge and resources of the community, rather than being reliant on a single company for support and updates.

There are many open-source web builders and static-site generators available, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, as well as popular open-source apps like OpenOffice and GIMP. Each has its own pros and cons, so it's important to carefully consider your specific needs and goals when deciding which one to use.

One potential downside to using open-source technology is that it may require more technical expertise to set up and maintain, as you will be responsible for hosting and managing the website yourself. However, the benefits of reduced costs and increased flexibility and customization can often outweigh this disadvantage.

Overall, I would recommend considering the use of open-source technology for building your own website as it can provide a cost-effective and customizable solution that meets your business needs. So, it's a good choice for your committee working in the self-governance industry.

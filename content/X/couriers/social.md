Here are some ideas for an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest to promote your new courier business in the supply-chain industry:

Share behind-the-scenes photos and videos of your team working in the warehouse, loading up delivery trucks, and delivering packages to customers. This will give followers a glimpse into the inner workings of your business and make them feel more connected to your brand.

Share customer testimonials and reviews on your social media channels. This will help to build trust with potential customers and showcase the high-quality service that you offer.

Share tips and tricks for optimizing supply chain operations, such as how to properly package and label packages for delivery, how to track shipments, and how to streamline logistics processes. This will position you as a thought leader in the industry and attract followers who are interested in improving their own supply chain operations.

Run a social media contest or giveaway to encourage followers to engage with your brand. You could offer a prize such as a free delivery service or a discount on your services.

Utilize Instagram and Pinterest to share visually appealing content, such as images of your delivery trucks and packages being delivered to satisfied customers. This will help to create a positive brand image and attract followers who are interested in your business.

By implementing these strategies, you can create an engaging social media campaign that will help to promote your courier business and attract new customers.

The word "healer" can be traced back to the Old English word "h√¶ler," which means "one who makes whole." This word likely derived from the Proto-Germanic word "hailaz," which means "healthy." The meaning of the word "healer" has remained relatively unchanged over time, as it still refers to someone who helps to heal or cure illness or injury.

The phrase "complementary and alternative medicine" (also known as CAM) can be traced back to the late 20th century. The term "complementary" refers to therapies that are used in addition to traditional Western medicine, while "alternative" refers to therapies that are used in place of traditional Western medicine. The origins of these therapies can be traced back to ancient civilizations and traditional medical practices from around the world, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, and homeopathy. The meaning of these terms has remained relatively unchanged over time, as they still refer to non-mainstream medical practices that are used in conjunction with or as an alternative to traditional Western medicine.

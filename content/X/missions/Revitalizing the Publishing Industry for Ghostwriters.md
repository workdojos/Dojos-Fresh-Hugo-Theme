# Mission // #Revitalizing the Publishing Industry for Ghostwriters

**Project Brief**: Revitalizing the Publishing Industry for Ghostwriters

**Team Leader**: Janine

**Assignment**:
To analyze the current state of the publishing industry and develop a strategy to revitalize it for ghostwriters. The team will focus on identifying the challenges facing ghostwriters in the industry and finding solutions to overcome them. The goal is to make the industry more accessible, profitable, and appealing to ghostwriters, which will ultimately benefit both ghostwriters and publishers.

**Goals**:

To research and understand the current state of the publishing industry and the challenges facing ghostwriters.
To identify the best practices in the industry and the factors contributing to their success.
To develop a strategy to revitalize the industry for ghostwriters, including new ways of working, new revenue streams, and new opportunities for growth.
To implement the strategy and monitor its effectiveness.
**Stakes**:

The publishing industry is in a state of flux, and ghostwriters are facing new challenges as a result.
If the team is unable to revitalize the industry, ghostwriters will continue to struggle, and the publishing industry will continue to decline.

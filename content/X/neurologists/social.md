Sure, here are some ideas for an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest to promote your new business as a neurologist:

Instagram: Share photos and videos showcasing your work as a neurologist, including before and after pictures of patients, testimonials from satisfied clients, and behind-the-scenes looks at your office and treatment methods. Use hashtags relevant to the neurology and mental health industry, such as #neurology #mentalhealthawareness #brainhealth.

Twitter: Tweet out tips and information related to neurology and mental health, such as the importance of getting enough sleep, the benefits of regular exercise, and ways to reduce stress. Use hashtags to reach a wider audience, such as #healthyliving #mentalwellness #neurologytips.

YouTube: Create a series of short videos explaining different aspects of neurology and mental health in an easy-to-understand way. These could be interviews with patients, explanations of common conditions, or Q&A sessions with you as the expert.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring infographics, articles, and other resources related to neurology and mental health. Pin images and quotes that promote the importance of taking care of your brain and seeking professional help when needed. Use hashtags to reach a wider audience, such as #neurology #mentalhealthawareness #brainhealth.

Remember to engage with your followers by responding to comments and messages, and encouraging them to share your content with their own followers.

The word "pharmacist" comes from the Greek word "pharmakos," which means "drug" or "medicine." The word "pharmaceutical" comes from the Greek word "pharmakeia," which means "the use of drugs."

Both words have their roots in ancient Greek culture, where the practice of using drugs and potions for medicinal purposes was common. In ancient Greek society, pharmacists were highly respected professionals who were responsible for preparing and dispensing medication. They were also responsible for the production of drugs, and many pharmacists were also skilled in the art of alchemy.

Over time, the meaning of the word "pharmaceutical" has evolved to refer to the science and practice of preparing and distributing drugs. Today, pharmaceuticals are a vital part of modern medicine and are used to treat a wide range of medical conditions. Similarly, the word "pharmacist" has come to refer to professionals who are trained in the science and practice of pharmacy, and who are responsible for dispensing and providing advice on the use of medications.

The word "playwright" is derived from the Old English word "plegan," which means "to play," and "write," which means "to write." The word was first recorded in the 14th century and referred to a person who wrote plays for the theater.

The word "performing arts" is derived from the Latin word "performare," which means "to carry out" or "to accomplish." The term originally referred to any type of artistic expression that was presented to an audience, including music, dance, and theater.

Over time, the meanings of both words have remained relatively unchanged. A playwright is still a person who writes plays, and performing arts is still a broad term used to describe any type of artistic expression that is presented to an audience. However, the concept of what is considered "performing arts" has evolved and expanded over time, with the inclusion of newer art forms such as film, television, and digital media.

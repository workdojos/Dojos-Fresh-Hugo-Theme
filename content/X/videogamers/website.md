As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for a few key reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization in the development process. This means that you can tailor the website to your specific business needs and goals, rather than being limited by the constraints of a proprietary platform.

In addition, using open-source technology often comes with a lower cost compared to proprietary options. This is because you do not have to pay licensing fees or subscription costs, and you have access to a community of developers who can offer support and contribute to the project.

As far as specific open-source web builders and static-site generators, some popular options in the gaming industry include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and integrations, and have a strong community of users and developers.

Other open-source apps that may be useful for your business include project management tools like Trello and Asana, and communication platforms like Slack.

Of course, there are also potential drawbacks to using open-source technology. One concern is the potential for security vulnerabilities, as the source code is open for anyone to see and potentially exploit. However, this can be mitigated through proper security measures and regular updates.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your own website far outweigh the potential cons. By leveraging the flexibility, customization, and lower cost of open-source options, you can create a website that meets your business goals and delivers a great user experience.

There are several benefits to using open-source technology to build your own website as a social media influencer. One of the main benefits is the cost savings. Open-source technologies are typically free to use and do not require any licensing fees. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses or individuals who may not have the budget for expensive proprietary software.

In addition to cost savings, open-source technologies offer a high level of customization and flexibility. You can easily modify and customize the code to fit your specific needs and requirements. This can be particularly useful for those working in the social media industry, as you may want to incorporate specific features and functionality that are relevant to your audience and business goals.

There are a number of popular open-source web builders and static-site generators available, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These tools offer a user-friendly interface and a range of features and functionality, including responsive design, social media integration, and e-commerce capabilities.

One potential drawback to using open-source technologies is that you may need to have some technical knowledge or hire a developer in order to fully customize and optimize your website. However, the cost savings and level of customization may outweigh this consideration.

Overall, using open-source technology can be a cost-effective and flexible solution for building a website as a social media influencer. It is important to carefully consider your specific needs and goals, and research the pros and cons of different open-source technologies before making a decision.

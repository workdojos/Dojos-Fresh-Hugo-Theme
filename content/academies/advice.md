First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your interest in pursuing a career in academia and higher education. This field is both rewarding and challenging, and requires a strong passion for teaching and learning.

To determine whether this career path is suitable for you, we should first take a look at your skills, interests, and experience. Do you have a strong background in a particular subject area? Do you enjoy researching and staying up-to-date on the latest developments in your field? Do you have excellent communication and presentation skills, and enjoy working with others in a collaborative environment? These are all important qualities to have as an academic.

Next, it would be helpful to conduct some research on the job market trends in academia and higher education. This can include looking at the demand for certain subject areas, the availability of positions at different institutions, and the qualifications and experience that are typically required for these roles. You may also want to consider whether you would prefer to work at a research-focused institution or a teaching-focused institution, as this can impact your career options.

In terms of qualifications, a doctoral degree is typically required for academic positions at the university level. This can take several years to complete, and may involve both coursework and research. Depending on your subject area, you may also need to have additional certifications or credentials, such as a teaching license or certification in a particular area of expertise.

Overall, a career in academia and higher education can be very rewarding for those who are passionate about teaching, learning, and research. If you have the necessary skills, interests, and experience, and are willing to put in the time and effort to pursue the necessary qualifications, this may be an excellent career path for you. Good luck!

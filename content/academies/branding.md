Sure, I can definitely help with that. Here are some potential strategies I would recommend for managing the organization's presence on social media:

Develop a content calendar: Start by creating a schedule for posting regular updates across Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. This can include sharing news, updates, events, and other content relevant to the organization and its audience.

Engage with followers: Monitor the organization's social media accounts regularly and respond to questions, comments, and messages from followers. This will help to build a loyal and engaged community around the organization.

Use hashtags: Include relevant hashtags in social media posts to make them more discoverable to potential followers and to help increase brand awareness.

Collaborate with others: Look for opportunities to collaborate with other organizations and individuals in the academia and higher education industry. This could include sharing content, hosting events, or participating in online discussions.

Utilize analytics: Use social media analytics tools to track the performance of different posts and campaigns. This will help to identify what is working well and what could be improved upon in future campaigns.

Overall, the goal of these strategies will be to increase brand awareness, recruit followers, drive traffic to the organization's website, and facilitate collaboration with others in the academia and higher education industry.

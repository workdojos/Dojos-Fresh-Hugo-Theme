First, let's start with Instagram. One way to engage with followers and promote your business is to post visually appealing content that showcases your expertise and knowledge in the academia and higher education industry. This can include behind-the-scenes glimpses of your work, tips and tricks for students and professionals, and thought-provoking discussions on current trends and issues in the field.

To create a cohesive campaign, consider using a consistent hashtag and visual theme for your posts. This will make it easier for followers to find your content and engage with it. You could also consider hosting Instagram live sessions or Q&A sessions where you answer questions and provide valuable insights to your followers.

On Twitter, you can use the platform's 280 character limit to your advantage by sharing quick tips, quotes, and updates about your business and the industry. You can also use Twitter to connect with other professionals and thought leaders in your field, which can help you grow your following and build your professional network.

For YouTube, consider creating educational videos or webinars that showcase your knowledge and expertise in the academia and higher education industry. You could also create vlogs that document your journey as a academic and share your experiences with your followers.

Finally, for Pinterest, you can create boards featuring resources and inspiration for students and professionals in the academia and higher education industry. You can also use Pinterest to showcase your own work and projects, and share links to your blog or website.

Overall, the key to creating an engaging campaign is to consistently share valuable and interesting content, and be proactive in engaging with your followers. By doing so, you can establish yourself as a trusted resource in your field and effectively promote your business.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend that having your own website can greatly benefit your academic career and business within the higher education industry. Not only does it provide a professional online presence and platform for you to share your research and expertise, but it also allows for better discoverability and accessibility for potential collaborators, students, and clients.

When it comes to creating a website, there are various web builders available that can cater to your specific needs and goals. Some popular options include Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly, which offer customizable templates and easy-to-use drag-and-drop interfaces. These platforms are generally suitable for those who are new to website development and do not have advanced coding skills.

However, if you have a specific vision for your website and want more control over its design and functionality, you may want to consider using a content management system (CMS) such as WordPress or Joomla. These platforms offer more flexibility and require some coding knowledge, but also offer a wider range of features and extensions.

Ultimately, the choice of web builder will depend on your specific needs and goals for your website. It is important to consider factors such as budget, design preferences, and the level of customization you require. I would recommend researching and comparing different options to find the best fit for your academic business.

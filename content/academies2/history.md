The word "academic" comes from the Latin word "academia," which refers to a place of study or learning. The word "academia" is derived from the name of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, who founded a school of philosophy called the Academy in Athens. The Academy was a place where philosophers and intellectuals could come together to discuss and study the nature of knowledge and truth.

The word "academia" has been used to refer to the world of higher education and scholarship since the 17th century, and the term "academic" has been used to describe people who are engaged in this world of learning. The meaning of the word "academic" has remained relatively unchanged over time, but it has also come to be associated with formal, theoretical, or abstract knowledge and learning, as opposed to practical or applied knowledge.

The term "higher education" refers to the education that is provided at colleges and universities, which are institutions of higher learning that offer advanced degrees such as bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. The word "higher" in this context refers to the level of education being offered, which is more advanced than the education provided at primary and secondary schools. The concept of higher education has a long history, dating back to the ancient Greeks and Romans, who established institutions of higher learning such as the Academy and the University of Alexandria. Today, higher education is considered an important part of a person's education and is often necessary for certain careers and professional advancement.

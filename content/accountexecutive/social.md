Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest to promote your new business as an account executive in the sales industry:

Instagram: Create a visually appealing feed that showcases your expertise in the sales industry.

Utilize Instagram Stories to connect with your followers and share valuable tips and advice on how to excel in sales.

Twitter: Tweet about your daily sales journey and share relevant industry news and insights. Use hashtags to reach a wider audience and engage with other sales professionals and potential clients.

YouTube: Create a YouTube channel where you share informative and entertaining sales-related videos. This could include sales tips and tricks, client testimonials, and industry insights.

Pinterest: Create a Pinterest board that showcases your sales expertise and showcases your products or services. Pin helpful resources and infographics related to sales, and use Pinterest's search function to find relevant keywords and hashtags to increase your visibility.

Overall, the key to a successful social media campaign is to be authentic, engaging, and consistent. By sharing valuable content and interacting with your followers, you can build a loyal following and effectively promote your business as an account executive in the sales industry.`

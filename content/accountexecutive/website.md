As a web design consultant, I would first recommend having your own website for several reasons. Firstly, having your own website allows you to have a professional online presence, giving potential clients a place to learn more about your company and the services you offer. This can help establish credibility and trust with potential clients.

Secondly, having your own website allows you to have control over the content and design of your site, allowing you to effectively market your services and highlight your unique selling points. A website can also serve as a platform for lead generation, allowing clients to easily contact you and inquire about your services.

As for creating a website for your business as an account executive in the sales industry, there are several web builders available that can help you create a professional and user-friendly website. Some of the leading web builders include WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace.

WordPress is a popular choice for businesses as it offers a wide range of customizable themes and plugins, allowing you to easily create a professional-looking website. It also has a large user community, making it easy to find support and resources when needed.

Wix is another popular choice, offering a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface and a wide range of templates and design options. It is a good choice for those who are not familiar with coding languages, as it allows you to easily create a website without the need for coding skills.

Squarespace is a more premium option, offering a sleek and modern interface and a range of customizable templates. It is a good choice for businesses looking to create a more sophisticated and professional website.

Overall, the best web builder for your business will depend on your specific needs and goals. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option and choose the one that best meets your business's needs and budget.

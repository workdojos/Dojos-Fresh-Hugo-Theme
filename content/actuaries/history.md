The word "actuary" has its roots in the Latin word "actuarius," which means "accountant." The term was originally used to refer to a person who was responsible for keeping track of financial records, particularly in the insurance industry. In the 18th century, the word began to be used to describe a person who calculated and managed risk in the insurance industry, using statistical data and mathematical models to predict the likelihood of events occurring. Today, an actuary is still a professional who uses statistical analysis to assess and manage risk, but the focus has expanded to include a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, and government.

The term "risk assessment" can be traced back to the late 19th century, when it was first used to describe the process of evaluating the potential risks associated with a particular activity or decision. The concept of risk assessment has evolved over time, and today it is a common practice in many industries to evaluate and manage risk in order to make informed decisions and protect against potential losses. Risk assessment involves identifying and analyzing potential risks, evaluating the likelihood and impact of those risks, and implementing strategies to mitigate or minimize those risks.

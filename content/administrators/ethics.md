As a philosopher, one might approach this task by first considering the various ethical theories that have been proposed throughout history. For example, a deontological approach might focus on the duties and responsibilities that a business administrator has to their clients and employees, while a consequentialist approach might prioritize the overall consequences of their actions for all stakeholders.

Additionally, it could be helpful to consider the specific values and goals of the business in question. For instance, if the business aims to be environmentally sustainable, then an eco-centric ethical framework might be particularly relevant. On the other hand, if the business is focused on maximizing profits, then a more egoistic or utilitarian approach might be more appropriate.

Ultimately, the development of an ethical framework for a business is a complex and multifaceted task that requires careful consideration of a wide range of factors. It is important for the business administrator to be aware of their own values and biases, as well as the values and expectations of their stakeholders, in order to create a framework that is fair, just, and in line with the overall goals of the business.

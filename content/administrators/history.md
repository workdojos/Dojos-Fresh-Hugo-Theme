The word "administrator" comes from the Latin "administrātor," which means "one who manages affairs." This word was formed by combining "ad-" (meaning "to" or "toward") with "ministrāre" (meaning "to serve"). The word "administration" comes from the same root, with the addition of the suffix "-tion," which indicates a process or state.

The word "administrator" first appeared in English in the early 15th century, and referred to a person who was responsible for managing the affairs of a household, organization, or estate. Over time, the meaning of the word has broadened to refer to any person who is responsible for the management of a particular area of responsibility, such as a school, hospital, or government agency.

The word "book-keeping" also has its roots in the Latin language. It comes from the word "libra," which means "balance." The suffix "-keeping" refers to the act of keeping or maintaining something, in this case, the balance of financial accounts. The word "book-keeping" has been in use in English since the late 14th century, and originally referred to the act of keeping financial accounts in a book or ledger. Today, the term is used to refer to the process of recording and tracking financial transactions for an organization or individual.

As a web design consultant, I recommend having a website for your business in the administration and bookkeeping industry for several reasons. Firstly, a website allows you to showcase your services and skills to a larger audience, which can help you attract more potential clients. It can also serve as a hub for important information about your business, including contact details, pricing, and client testimonials.

In terms of creating a website, there are several web builders that you can use to get started. Some of the leading options include Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly. These platforms offer a range of templates and customization options that make it easy to create a professional-looking website without needing to have coding experience.

One of the main benefits of using a web builder is that they are usually user-friendly and require minimal technical knowledge. This means that you can focus on creating content and designing your website, rather than worrying about the technical aspects of development.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using a web builder. These platforms can be more expensive than other options, and they may not offer the same level of customization or flexibility as more advanced development tools like WordPress.

Ultimately, the best choice for your business will depend on your specific needs and goals. However, I recommend doing some research and considering all of your options before making a decision. This will help you choose the best platform for your business and ensure that your website meets your needs and delivers the best user experience for your visitors.

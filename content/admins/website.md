As a web design consultant, I would suggest that having your own website is essential for any business, especially in today's digital age. A website can serve as an online storefront, providing information about your business, products or services, and allowing potential customers to learn more about what you have to offer.

There are several benefits to having your own website:

Increased visibility: A website can help you reach a wider audience, as anyone with an internet connection can access it. This can be especially useful if you are targeting a specific market or location.

Professional image: A well-designed website can help you establish a professional image and establish trust with your customers.

Greater convenience: A website can provide customers with easy access to information about your business, products, and services, making it easier for them to do business with you.

Cost-effective marketing: A website can be a cost-effective way to market your business, as it can reach a large audience for a relatively low cost.

There are many web builders available that can help you create a website for your business. Some of the leading web builders include:

Wix: Wix is a popular web builder that offers a range of templates and design options to help you create a professional-looking website.

Weebly: Weebly is another popular web builder that offers a range of templates and design options to help you create a website that meets your business needs.

Squarespace: Squarespace is a web builder that offers a range of templates and design options, as well as e-commerce capabilities, to help you create a website that meets your business needs.

Each of these web builders has its own pros and cons, so it's important to consider your business needs and goals when deciding which one is right for you.

Overall, I would recommend that you invest in creating a website for your business as it can help you reach a wider audience, establish a professional image, and provide convenient access to information about your business, products, and services.

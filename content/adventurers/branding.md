First, I would start by researching the outdoor adventure industry and identifying key influencers and potential collaboration partners on social media. I would also research the organization's target audience to understand their interests and preferences.

Next, I would create a content calendar outlining the types of content to be posted on each platform and the frequency of posting. This could include posts about upcoming events, tips and tricks for outdoor adventures, showcasing customer experiences, and promoting new products or services.

I would also engage with the audience by responding to comments and questions on social media and using hashtags to reach a wider audience. I would use analytics to track the success of each campaign and make adjustments as needed.

To increase brand awareness, I would use targeted advertising on Instagram and Twitter to reach a specific audience and encourage them to follow the organization's social media accounts. I would also consider collaborating with influencers or other organizations in the outdoor adventure industry to reach a larger audience and drive traffic to the website.

Overall, my goal as a social media manager for this organization would be to create engaging content and actively engage with the audience to increase brand awareness, recruit followers, and drive traffic and conversions.

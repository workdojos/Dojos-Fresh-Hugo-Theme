Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign to promote your new outdoor adventure business:

Instagram: Create visually stunning posts showcasing your adventures, whether it's hiking through beautiful landscapes, rock climbing, or kayaking. Use relevant hashtags such as #outdooradventure #hiking #kayaking #rockclimbing to reach a wider audience. You can also create Instagram stories highlighting behind-the-scenes moments and Q&A sessions with followers.

Twitter: Use Twitter to share updates on your adventures, such as pictures or videos of your latest trip. Tweet out interesting facts about the outdoors and engage with followers by asking them questions about their own outdoor experiences.

Youtube: Create a Youtube channel to document your adventures and share tips and tricks for those interested in getting into outdoor adventure. You can also create vlogs showcasing your adventures in a more personal way, allowing followers to get to know you better.

Pinterest: Use Pinterest to create boards featuring beautiful outdoor landscapes, adventure gear, and inspiration for those looking to get into outdoor adventure. Pin your own content as well as others' to provide a well-rounded resource for your followers.

Overall, the key to an engaging social media campaign is to be authentic and share content that resonates with your target audience. Good luck with your new business!

One of the main issues is the lack of job opportunities and low pay in the industry. Many agriculturists are struggling to find work and are often forced to take on low-paying jobs that do not provide them with a decent standard of living.

This could involve increasing government funding for research and development, providing grants and loans to farmers and agriculturists, and investing in infrastructure that will help the industry to grow. Another way to improve the agriculture industry is by investing in education and training programs that will help agriculturists to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their careers.

Agriculturist:
The word "agriculturist" comes from the Latin word "agricultura," which means "cultivation of the land." It was originally used to describe people who were involved in farming and the cultivation of crops and animals for sustenance.

Over time, the meaning of the word "agriculturist" has broadened to include anyone who is involved in the science and practice of agriculture, including those who study it academically and those who work in the industry.

Agriculture:
The word "agriculture" also comes from the Latin "agricultura," and it refers to the cultivation of land for the production of crops and livestock. In ancient times, agriculture was a crucial part of human society, as it provided food and other resources for communities.

As with "agriculturist," the meaning of "agriculture" has expanded to include the scientific study of farming and the production of crops and livestock. It is now a vital industry that plays a significant role in global food production and economic development.

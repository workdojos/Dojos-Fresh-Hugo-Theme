Use hashtags related to agriculture, such as #agriculture #farming #sustainablefarming #farmerlife
Twitter:

Use hashtags related to agriculture, such as #agriculture #farming #sustainablefarming #farmerlife
YouTube:

Share vlogs or behind-the-scenes looks at your work as an agriculturist
Collaborate with other agriculturists or farmers in your area to create a series of videos showcasing different perspectives and experiences in the industry
Pinterest:

Don't be afraid to share your own experiences and insights, and consider collaborating with others in the industry to showcase a variety of perspectives. Hashtags are also a great way to reach a larger audience and connect with others in the industry.

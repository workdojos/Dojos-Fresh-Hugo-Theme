As a web design consultant, I would recommend that having your own website can greatly benefit your business as an animator in the animation industry. A website can serve as an online portfolio and showcase your work to potential clients, as well as allow you to establish a professional online presence.

There are several web builders available that can assist with creating a website for your business, including Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly. Each of these web builders have their own pros and cons, so it's important to consider your specific needs and goals before choosing the best option for your business.

Wix is a popular web builder that offers a range of templates and design options for creating professional websites. One of the main benefits of Wix is its ease of use, making it a great option for those who are new to website development. However, it may not offer as much customization as other web builders.

Squarespace is another popular web builder that offers a range of templates and design options, as well as a variety of features such as e-commerce capabilities and integrated marketing tools. However, it may be more expensive than other web builders and may require a higher level of technical knowledge to fully utilize its features.

Weebly is a web builder that is known for its ease of use and range of templates and design options. It also offers e-commerce capabilities and integrated marketing tools, but may not offer as much customization as other web builders.

Overall, it's important to consider your specific needs and goals when choosing a web builder for your business. It may be helpful to research and compare the different options to determine the best fit for your business.

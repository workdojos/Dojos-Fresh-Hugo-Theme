As a philosopher, I would approach the task of developing an ethical framework for starting a business as an app developer by considering the following questions:

What are the key values and principles that should guide the business? For example, should the business prioritize profit or social responsibility? Should it prioritize the needs of its customers or the needs of its employees?

How will the business balance the competing demands of various stakeholders? For example, should the business prioritize the needs of its customers over the needs of its shareholders?

How will the business ensure that it is acting in a fair and just manner towards all of its stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, and the community in which it operates?

How will the business ensure that it is acting in a responsible and sustainable manner, taking into account the impact of its operations on the environment and the wider society?

How will the business address any ethical dilemmas or conflicts that may arise in the course of its operations?

In order to develop a robust ethical framework for the business, it may be necessary to conduct research into various philosophical theories related to business ethics, such as deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics. It may also be necessary to consult with experts in the field of business ethics, such as ethicists or lawyers, to ensure that the framework is fully informed and comprehensive. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a framework that reflects the values and principles of the business, and that guides its actions in a responsible and ethical manner.

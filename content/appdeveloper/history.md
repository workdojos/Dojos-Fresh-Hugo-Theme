The word "app" is a shortened form of the word "application," which comes from the Latin word "applicare," meaning "to apply." The word "application" originally referred to the act of applying for something, such as a job or a loan. However, with the advent of computers and the internet, the word "application" came to refer to a program or software that performs a specific task or function on a computer.

The term "app developer" refers to a person who creates and develops apps for computers and mobile devices. The first known use of the term "app developer" was in the early 1990s, when the term "app" began to be used to describe computer programs specifically designed for mobile devices.

The word "software" is derived from the Old English word "sċēawian," meaning "to look at" or "to see." The term "software development" refers to the process of creating and developing software programs. The first known use of the term "software development" was in the late 1960s, when computers began to be used more widely in business and industry.

Over time, the meanings of both "app developer" and "software development" have evolved to encompass a wide range of activities related to the creation and development of computer programs and apps. Today, app developers and software developers are responsible for creating and maintaining the software that powers our computers, mobile devices, and other digital devices.

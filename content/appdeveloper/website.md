As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few key reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for a high level of customization and flexibility in the design and development process. This means you can tailor the website to meet the specific needs and goals of your business as an app developer. Additionally, open-source technology is often supported by a strong community of developers who can offer support and assistance if needed.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators available, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of templates and themes to choose from, making it easy to create a professional-looking website quickly. Other popular open-source apps for building websites include Ghost and Gatsby, which are both well-suited for creating fast-loading, visually appealing websites.

One of the main benefits of using open-source technology is the cost savings. Many open-source tools are free to use, although some may require a paid subscription for advanced features. This can be a significant cost savings compared to proprietary software, which often requires a license fee.

However, it's important to note that using open-source technology may require a higher level of technical expertise and the need to manage updates and security issues. It's also important to consider the long-term costs of hosting and maintaining the website, as well as the potential for additional development costs if custom features are needed.

Overall, using open-source technology can be a cost-effective and customizable option for building a website for your app development business. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons, as well as the long-term costs and maintenance requirements, before making a decision.

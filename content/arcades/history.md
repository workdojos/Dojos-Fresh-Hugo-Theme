The word "arcade" is derived from the Latin word "arcus," meaning "arch." In the medieval period, the term "arcade" referred to a covered walkway lined with arches, often found in public gardens or cloisters. The word later came to refer to a series of connected arches, used to support a roof or bridge.

In the early 20th century, the term "arcade" was adopted by the gaming industry to refer to a public space filled with coin-operated amusement games and vending machines. Today, the word "arcade" is most commonly associated with a type of entertainment venue featuring video games, pinball machines, and other electronic games.

The word "video game" is a relatively recent term, first coined in the 1950s when electronic games began to be displayed on cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. The word "video" comes from the Latin "videre," meaning "to see," and refers to the visual aspect of the game. The word "game" is derived from the Old English "gamen," meaning "play" or "amusement."

As the technology for video games has evolved, so has the meaning of the term "video game." Today, video games can be played on a variety of devices, including computers, consoles, and mobile phones, and can take many different forms, from simple puzzle games to complex simulations and role-playing games.

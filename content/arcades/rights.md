As an arcade owner in the video game industry, I believe it is crucial to prioritize fair work practices for my employees. This includes ensuring that they receive proper wages, are treated with respect and dignity, and are given opportunities for growth and advancement within the company.

In recent years, there have been numerous trends and events in the video game industry that highlight the importance of fair work practices. One such trend is the rise of "crunch culture," in which employees are expected to work long hours and put in excessive overtime in order to meet tight deadlines. This can lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction, as well as a negative impact on workers' mental and physical health.

Additionally, there have been numerous reports of widespread wage stagnation and pay gaps within the industry, with women and people of color often earning less than their white male counterparts. This is not only unfair, but it also hinders the industry's ability to attract and retain top talent.

As an arcade owner, I believe it is my responsibility to create a work environment that values and respects my employees. This includes offering fair wages, promoting a healthy work-life balance, and providing opportunities for professional development. I also believe in advocating for fair treatment and proper wages within the industry as a whole, as it is crucial to the long-term success and sustainability of the industry.

While it may be tempting to prioritize profits over the well-being and satisfaction of my employees, I believe that fair work practices ultimately lead to a more productive and successful company. By prioritizing the rights and needs of my workers, I can create a positive and supportive work environment that benefits both my employees and my business.

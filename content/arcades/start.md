First of all, congratulations on setting such a bold and exciting goal! Starting a business is a challenging and rewarding journey, and the video game industry is a dynamic and exciting field to be in. Here are a few strategies that may help you achieve your goal:

Research, research, research! It's important to have a solid understanding of the market and competition before launching a startup. This might involve researching industry trends, analyzing the success of existing arcades, and identifying potential customers. You can also reach out to other arcade owners or experts in the field to get their insights and advice.

Create a business plan. A business plan is a detailed roadmap that outlines your goals, target market, financial projections, and marketing strategies. It's an essential tool for any startup, and it will help you stay focused and organized as you move forward.

Build a strong support network. Starting a business can be a lonely journey, so it's important to surround yourself with supportive friends, family, and mentors who can offer guidance and encouragement. You can also join online communities or networking groups specifically for aspiring arcade owners to connect with others who are going through the same process.

Get excited about your career as an arcade owner! Share your passion for the industry with those around you and inspire them to join you on your journey. You can create social media accounts or a website to share updates and information about your startup, and consider hosting events or workshops to engage your community.

Remember, starting a business takes time, effort, and persistence. But with the right mindset and strategies, you can achieve your goal of becoming a successful arcade owner. Good luck!

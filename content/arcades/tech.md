The video game industry is a constantly evolving and competitive field that requires constant innovation to stay relevant. One way that the industry can continue to thrive is by embracing open-source technology.

Open-source technology allows for a level of transparency and collaboration that can benefit both developers and players. Developers can access a vast pool of knowledge and resources, and players can have more input and control over the games they play. This type of technology can also help to level the playing field for smaller studios, who may not have the same resources as larger companies.

As an arcade owner, embracing open-source technology can also help you to stay competitive and attract a wider range of customers. By offering unique and customizable experiences, you can differentiate yourself from other establishments and appeal to a more diverse group of gamers.

But the benefits of open-source technology extend beyond just the video game industry. Small businesses will play an integral role in a thriving economy in the future, and embracing open-source technology can help these businesses to stay competitive and innovative. By collaborating and sharing resources, small businesses can build upon each other's successes and create a more diverse and sustainable economy.

In conclusion, the video game industry and small businesses alike can benefit from embracing open-source technology. By fostering collaboration and transparency, we can create a more innovative and sustainable economy for all.

As a philosopher, it is important to consider the ethical implications of any action we take. Starting a business is no different, and it is crucial to consider how our business practices will impact not only ourselves, but also our clients and the larger community.

One ethical framework that could be applied to the advisory services industry is the principle of beneficence, which states that we should do good and seek to benefit others. This could involve providing honest and accurate advice to clients, being transparent about fees and conflicts of interest, and working to improve the financial well-being of our clients.

Another principle to consider is non-maleficence, or the idea that we should not cause harm to others. This could involve avoiding practices that could lead to financial harm for clients, such as providing advice that is not in their best interest or engaging in unethical sales tactics.

Additionally, it is important to consider the principle of autonomy, which states that we should respect the autonomy and decision-making abilities of our clients. This could involve providing them with the necessary information and resources to make informed decisions, and being transparent about the potential risks and benefits of different options.

Overall, it is important to be mindful of the ethical implications of our actions as a business owner, and to strive to do good and avoid harm in all of our business practices.

The word "advisor" comes from the Latin word "advisōrem," which means "to give counsel." It was originally used to describe someone who provided guidance or advice to another person. Over time, the meaning of the word has changed slightly, and it is now commonly used to refer to someone who gives professional or expert advice on a specific subject.

The word "consulting" is derived from the Latin word "consultāre," which means "to ask counsel." It was originally used to describe the act of seeking advice or guidance from someone else. Today, the word "consulting" is often used to refer to the practice of providing professional advice or services to businesses or organizations.

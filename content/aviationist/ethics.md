As a philosopher, I would begin by examining the fundamental principles that underlie ethical decision-making in business. This might include concepts such as the maximization of shareholder value, the responsibility to stakeholders, and the obligation to act with integrity and transparency.

Next, I would consider the specific ethical challenges that are unique to the aviation industry. For example, aviationists must navigate complex regulations and safety protocols, and must also consider the environmental impact of their work. In developing an ethical framework for starting a business in this field, it would be important to consider how these factors might influence decision-making.

Finally, I would suggest that it might be helpful to consult with experts in the field, including other aviationists, ethicists, and legal professionals. By seeking out diverse perspectives and engaging in open dialogue, it may be possible to develop a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to ethical decision-making in the aviation industry. So, the ethical framework for starting a business as a aviationist working in the aviation industry should be based on the fundamental principles of ethical decision-making in business, the specific ethical challenges of the aviation industry, and the input of diverse experts and stakeholders.

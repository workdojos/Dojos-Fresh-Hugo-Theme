The word aviationist is derived from the word aviation, which refers to the operation or management of aircraft. The word aviation is itself derived from the Latin word avis, meaning "bird." The suffix -ation is a common English suffix used to form nouns, and it is added to the root word aviation to form the noun aviationist, meaning "one who is skilled or interested in aviation."

The meaning of the word aviationist has not changed significantly since it was first coined in the early 20th century. It is still used to refer to someone who is knowledgeable or passionate about the operation and management of aircraft.

Aviation:

The word aviation is derived from the Latin word avis, meaning "bird." It was first used in English in the late 19th century to refer to the operation and management of aircraft. The word aviation has its roots in the ancient Roman and Greek cultures, where people believed that birds were divine creatures with the ability to fly. In ancient Rome, the word avis was used to refer to the goddess of victory, who was often depicted with wings.

Over time, the meaning of the word aviation has evolved to encompass the broader field of aeronautics, which includes the study of the design, construction, and operation of aircraft and spacecraft. Today, aviation is used to refer to the entire industry of aircraft manufacturing, operation, and maintenance.

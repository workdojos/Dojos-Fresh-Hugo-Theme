As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for a few reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for greater customization and flexibility in the design and functionality of your website. This can be especially useful for businesses in the aviation industry, as you may have specific needs or requirements that may not be met by a pre-made template or proprietary platform.

Additionally, using open-source technology can often be more cost-effective than purchasing a proprietary platform or hiring a developer to build a custom website. While there may be some upfront costs associated with learning and utilizing open-source tools, these costs can be offset by the long-term savings of not having to pay for ongoing subscriptions or maintenance fees.

As for specific open-source web builders and static-site generators, some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal for web builders, and Gatsby, Hugo, and Jekyll for static-site generators. Each of these platforms has its own pros and cons, so it's important to consider your specific needs and budget when deciding which one is the best fit for your business.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can be a great way to customize and optimize your online presence, while also saving money in the long run. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option, as well as the costs associated with each, in order to make the best decision for your business.

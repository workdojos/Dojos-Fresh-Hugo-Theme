As a philosopher, I would first recommend considering the ethical theories of deontology and consequentialism. Deontology, as proposed by philosopher Immanuel Kant, holds that the moral value of an action is determined by whether it follows the moral rule of "treating people as ends in themselves, not as means to an end." In the context of starting a business as a bankroller, this would mean considering the potential consequences of your actions on the individuals you are lending money to, rather than simply focusing on maximizing profits.

Consequentialism, on the other hand, holds that the moral value of an action is determined by the consequences it produces. In this case, you may consider the overall societal impact of your business, including the potential benefits and drawbacks to the community as a whole.

It may also be helpful to consider the principle of non-maleficence, which dictates that we should not cause harm to others. This could be applied to the money lending industry by ensuring that you are not taking advantage of individuals by charging excessively high interest rates or engaging in predatory lending practices.

Additionally, it may be useful to consider the principle of fairness and justice, as well as the concept of corporate social responsibility. This could involve ensuring that your business is treating all of its clients fairly and ethically, as well as considering the broader social and environmental impacts of your business operations.

Overall, it is important to consider the potential consequences of your actions on both individuals and society, as well as upholding principles of fairness, non-maleficence, and justice in order to develop an ethical framework for starting a business as a bankroller in the money lending industry.

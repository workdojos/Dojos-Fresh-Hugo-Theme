The word "bankroller" can be traced back to the early 18th century, when it was used to refer to someone who provided financial support or funding for a particular project or enterprise. The word is derived from the noun "bank," which originally referred to a place where money was deposited or stored, and the verb "roll," which means to move or turn. Together, the word "bankroller" literally means someone who rolls or provides financial support from a bank.

The word "money lending" can be traced back to the late Middle English period, when it was used to refer to the practice of borrowing and lending money for a specific period of time, often at a specific interest rate. The word is derived from the noun "money," which refers to a medium of exchange or a unit of currency, and the verb "lend," which means to give something to someone temporarily, with the expectation that it will be returned. Together, the phrase "money lending" refers to the act of giving money to someone with the expectation that it will be returned, often with interest.

Over time, both of these words have remained relatively stable in meaning, with only minor changes in usage and connotation. "Bankroller" is still used to refer to someone who provides financial support or funding, while "money lending" is still used to refer to the act of borrowing and lending money. However, both words have taken on additional meanings and connotations in modern usage, with "bankroller" sometimes being used to refer to someone who is financially successful or wealthy, and "money lending" sometimes being used to refer to the practice of providing loans to individuals or businesses.

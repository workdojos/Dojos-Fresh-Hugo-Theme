As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for a number of reasons. Firstly, open-source technology is generally free to use, meaning that you won't have to pay any licensing fees or upfront costs for the tools and platforms you need to build your website. This can be a significant cost saving for a business, particularly if you are working on a tight budget.

Secondly, open-source technology is often highly customizable, meaning that you can tailor the look and feel of your website to meet your specific business needs. This can be particularly important in the money lending industry, where you may want to present a professional, trustworthy image to your customers.

There are a number of popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that you can use to build your website, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a range of features and tools that can help you create a functional, visually appealing website quickly and easily.

Other popular open-source apps that can enhance the user experience of your website include e-commerce platforms like Magento and WooCommerce, as well as customer relationship management (CRM) tools like Salesforce and Zoho.

One potential downside of using open-source technology is that you may not have the same level of support as you would with a proprietary platform. However, there are often large online communities of users and developers who can provide assistance and troubleshooting guidance.

In terms of costs, using open-source technology will generally be cheaper than proprietary platforms, as you won't have to pay any licensing fees. However, you may still need to invest in hosting, domain registration, and other services in order to get your website up and running. Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your own website far outweigh the potential costs and drawbacks, and can help you create a professional, user-friendly website that meets your business goals.

Idea Name: Brew2Go

One Liner: A mobile app that connects users with local baristas for personalized, in-home coffee experiences.

Target User Persona: Coffee enthusiasts who want to elevate their home coffee game, but don't have the time or expertise to visit a coffee shop regularly.

User's Pain Points: Limited access to quality coffee outside of traditional coffee shops, lack of knowledge on how to make specialty drinks at home, and time constraints.

Main Value Proposition: Brew2Go offers users the opportunity to have a professional barista come to their home to teach them how to make specialty drinks, and provide personalized recommendations for their coffee preferences. Additionally, users can order coffee beans and brewing equipment directly through the app.

Sales & Marketing Channels: Social media marketing, targeted email campaigns, partnerships with local coffee shops, and word of mouth referrals.

Revenue Stream Sources: Fees for barista services, commissions on coffee beans and brewing equipment sales, and subscription fees for monthly coffee bean delivery.

Cost Structure: Barista wages, marketing and advertising expenses, app development and maintenance costs.

Key Activities: Recruiting and training baristas, maintaining relationships with local coffee shops and roasters, developing and updating the app, and managing customer relationships.

Key Resources: Baristas, marketing and advertising budget, app development and maintenance team, and relationships with local coffee shops and roasters.

Key Partners: Local coffee shops and roasters, app development and maintenance companies.

Idea Validation Steps: Conduct market research to determine the demand for in-home barista services, pilot the service with a small group of users, gather feedback and make adjustments accordingly.

Estimated 1st Year Cost of Operation: $50,000

Potential Business Challenges: Finding and retaining qualified baristas, competing with traditional coffee shops, and navigating the challenges of operating an on-demand service.

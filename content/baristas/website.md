As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few reasons.

First, open-source technology allows you to have complete control over your website. This means you can customize it to meet your specific business needs and goals, rather than being limited to the features and functionality of a proprietary platform.

Second, open-source technology is often more cost-effective. Many proprietary platforms charge monthly or yearly subscription fees, whereas open-source technology is often free to use. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses or startups on a tight budget.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that can be used to create a professional-looking website for your business. Some options to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which are popular content management systems that can be used to create both simple and complex websites. Other options include static-site generators like Jekyll or Hexo, which are great for creating fast-loading, lightweight websites with minimal effort.

It's worth noting that there are also some potential downsides to using open-source technology. For example, it may require more technical knowledge to set up and maintain a website built with open-source tools, as you will not have the support of a proprietary platform. Additionally, open-source technology may not always be as user-friendly as proprietary platforms, so it may take some time to get used to using it.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your website far outweigh the potential downsides. With the right tools and resources, you can create a professional-looking website that meets your business needs and goals, all while saving money on monthly or yearly subscription fees.

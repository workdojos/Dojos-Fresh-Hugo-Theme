Thank you for seeking career counseling. As a bartender, you will need to possess strong customer service skills, as well as the ability to multitask and work in a fast-paced environment. You should also have a strong knowledge of different types of drinks and the ability to make them quickly and accurately.

There are many different opportunities within the bartending and hospitality industry, including working at restaurants, hotels, bars, and clubs. You could also consider becoming a catering bartender or working at events and parties.

In terms of job market trends, the hospitality industry is expected to grow over the next decade, with an increase in demand for bartenders and other service industry professionals.

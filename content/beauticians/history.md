Beautician: The word "beautician" is derived from the Latin "beatus," which means "happy" or "blessed." The term was originally used to describe someone who was skilled in the art of beautification and could help others feel happy and blessed through their work.

Over time, the meaning of the word "beautician" has evolved to refer specifically to someone who works in the beauty industry, providing services such as haircuts, styling, makeup application, and skincare treatments.

Health & wellness: The word "health" can be traced back to the Old English word "h√¶lth," which means "wholeness" or "soundness." The word "wellness" is derived from the Old English "weol," which means "well-being."

The concept of health and wellness has evolved over time to encompass not just physical well-being, but also mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Today, the term "health and wellness" is often used to refer to a holistic approach to living that focuses on maintaining overall well-being through diet, exercise, stress management, and other healthy lifestyle practices.

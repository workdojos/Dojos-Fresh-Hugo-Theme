Here are some ideas for an Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest campaign to promote your new business as a beautician in the health & wellness industry:

Instagram: Share behind-the-scenes photos and videos of your beauty treatments and products, as well as tips and tricks for maintaining healthy skin and hair. Encourage your followers to share their own skincare routines and tag you in their posts using a specific hashtag.

Twitter: Tweet out daily beauty tips, product recommendations, and inspiration for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Engage with your followers by asking for their input on beauty-related topics and retweeting their tweets.

YouTube: Create videos showcasing your beauty treatments and products, as well as step-by-step tutorials for skincare routines and makeup looks. Share your knowledge and expertise on health & wellness by creating vlogs discussing various topics such as natural remedies, healthy eating habits, and stress management.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring your beauty products and treatments, as well as inspiration for healthy living. Pin your own blog posts or articles related to health & wellness, and re-pin content from other influencers or brands in the industry.

Remember to always use hashtags and tag relevant accounts in your posts to increase visibility and reach. Engage with your followers by responding to comments and messages, and consider running a contest or giveaway to increase engagement and drive traffic to your business.

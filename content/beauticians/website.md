As a web design consultant, I would recommend considering open-source technology as a viable option for building your website. There are several benefits to using open-source technology, including:

Cost: One of the main benefits of open-source technology is the fact that it is usually free to use. This can be especially appealing for small businesses that may not have a large budget for website development.

Customization: With open-source technology, you have the ability to fully customize your website to meet your specific needs and goals. This can be especially useful for businesses in the health and wellness industry, where a unique and personalized approach is often important.

Community support: Open-source technology often has a strong community of users and developers who are willing to help troubleshoot issues and offer advice and support. This can be a valuable resource for businesses that may not have a dedicated web development team.

In terms of specific open-source web builders and static-site generators, some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and functionality, and can be easily customized to meet the needs of your business.

There are also several popular open-source apps that can enhance the overall user experience on your website. Some examples include e-commerce platforms like Magento and WooCommerce, and customer relationship management systems like SugarCRM.

Overall, the pros and cons of using open-source technology will depend on your specific business needs and goals. However, in general, it can be a cost-effective and customizable solution that offers strong community support. It is worth considering as you plan the development of your website.

As the social media manager for the beer garden organization, I would recommend the following strategies:

Develop a content calendar that includes a mix of promotional and educational content. This could include posts about events, specials, and new beer releases, as well as posts about the history of beer, the brewing process, and beer pairing suggestions.

Use hashtags to increase the visibility of your posts and to join relevant conversations. For example, you could use hashtags like #beergarden, #craftbeer, and #beertasting to reach a wider audience.

Engage with other beer gardens and breweries on social media. This could involve commenting on their posts, sharing their content, and possibly even collaborating on a joint promotion or event.

Utilize Instagram and Pinterest to showcase the atmosphere and offerings at your beer garden. This could include photos of your outdoor seating, beer taps, and menu items.

Use analytics tools to track your social media performance and identify areas for improvement. This could include tracking metrics like reach, engagement, and website traffic to see which types of content are resonating with your audience.

Respond promptly to any questions or comments from followers to build a sense of community and demonstrate that you value their feedback.

Overall, my goal would be to create a social media presence that is informative, engaging, and visually appealing, in order to increase brand awareness, recruit followers, drive traffic to your website, and create opportunities for collaboration.

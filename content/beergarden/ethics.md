As a philosopher, I would approach this task by examining the various ethical theories that could be applied to the situation of starting a career as a beer garden owner. One possibility is the consequentialist approach, which emphasizes the importance of considering the consequences of one's actions and making decisions based on their potential to promote overall happiness or well-being. In this case, one might consider the potential consequences of becoming a beer garden owner on both the individual level (e.g. financial success, personal satisfaction) and the societal level (e.g. the impact on the community, the potential for contributing to social issues such as alcohol abuse).

Another approach that could be taken is the deontological approach, which emphasizes the importance of following moral duties or rules regardless of the consequences. In this case, one might consider the ethical obligations that come with being a beer garden owner, such as ensuring the safety of patrons and not contributing to harmful behaviors.

Additionally, the virtue ethics approach, which emphasizes the importance of cultivating virtues or good character traits, could also be applied. In this case, one might consider the virtues that are necessary for being a responsible and successful beer garden owner, such as honesty, fairness, and compassion.

Ultimately, the ethical framework for starting a career as a beer garden owner will depend on the individual's values and priorities. It is important to carefully consider the various ethical approaches and determine which aligns most closely with one's personal values and goals.

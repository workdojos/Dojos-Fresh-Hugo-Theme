The beer garden industry has grown exponentially over the past few decades, with the number of breweries in the United States alone increasing from just over 2,000 in the 1980s to over 7,000 in 2019. This growth has resulted in a multitude of job opportunities within the industry, ranging from brewery workers to taproom managers and beyond.

One way to find opportunities within the beer garden industry is to reach out to local breweries and inquire about open positions. Many breweries are always looking for new employees, and networking with those already working in the industry can also help open doors. Attending industry events and trade shows, such as the Great American Beer Festival, is another excellent way to connect with professionals and learn about job openings.

There are numerous exciting aspects of working in the beer garden industry, including the opportunity to be creative and innovative with new brews, the chance to work with a team of passionate and dedicated individuals, and the opportunity to be a part of a community that values craftsmanship and quality.

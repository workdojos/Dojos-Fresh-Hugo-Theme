First, I would begin by creating a social media strategy that outlines the goals and objectives for each platform. This would include identifying the target audience, defining the tone and voice of the content, and creating a content calendar that includes a mix of promotional, educational, and engaging posts.

Next, I would focus on increasing brand awareness by regularly posting updates and engaging with the audience through Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. This could include sharing industry news, hosting live Q&A sessions, and using hashtags to reach a wider audience.

To drive traffic to the website, I would include links to relevant articles and resources in social media posts, as well as promoting events or webinars that may be of interest to the target audience.

To increase conversions, I would focus on creating high-quality content that resonates with the audience and encourages them to take action. This could include sharing success stories, showcasing products or services, and providing valuable resources that help solve common problems.

Finally, I would seek out opportunities for collaboration with other organizations in the biosciences industry, including sharing content and co-hosting events. This could help increase brand awareness and build relationships with key industry influencers.

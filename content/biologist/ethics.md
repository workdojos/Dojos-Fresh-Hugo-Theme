As a philosopher, I would first recommend considering the ethical theories of deontology and utilitarianism. Deontology emphasizes the importance of following moral duties and principles, regardless of the consequences. In the context of a career as a biologist, this could involve adhering to ethical guidelines for conducting research, such as obtaining informed consent from participants or avoiding harm to animals.

Utilitarianism, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of maximizing overall happiness or well-being. In the context of a career as a biologist, this could involve prioritizing actions that have the greatest positive impact on society, such as developing treatments for diseases or protecting the environment.

It may also be helpful to consider the concept of virtue ethics, which emphasizes the importance of developing character traits such as honesty, compassion, and fairness. In a career as a biologist, this could involve striving to be a trustworthy and responsible researcher, as well as being empathetic and respectful towards colleagues and subjects.

Additionally, it may be useful to consider the potential consequences of your actions on a global scale, and how they align with global ethical principles such as human rights and environmental sustainability.

Overall, it is important to approach your career as a biologist with a strong sense of moral responsibility and a commitment to ethical principles. By considering the various ethical theories and principles outlined above, you can develop a comprehensive ethical framework that guides your actions and decision-making as you embark on your career in the biosciences industry.

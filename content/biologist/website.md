As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons.

Firstly, open-source technology is typically free to use and allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website. This means that you can build a website that is tailored to your specific business needs and goals without incurring any additional costs.

Secondly, open-source technology is constantly being updated and improved by a community of developers, which means that you can benefit from the latest features and functionality without having to pay for expensive upgrades.

In terms of specific open-source web builders and static-site generators, there are a number of options available that can deliver a great user experience for your business. Some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which offer a range of customizable templates and features that can be easily integrated into your website. Other options include static-site generators such as Gatsby and Hugo, which are ideal for building fast, lightweight websites that can be easily deployed on your own server.

Overall, the main benefits of using open-source technology to build your website are the cost savings and flexibility it offers, as well as the constantly evolving feature set provided by the community of developers working on the technology. However, it is important to consider the time and resources required to build and maintain a website using open-source technology, as well as the potential risks associated with relying on a third-party platform. Overall, the pros and cons of using open-source technology will depend on your specific business needs and goals.

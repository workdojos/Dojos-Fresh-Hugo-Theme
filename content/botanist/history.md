The word botanist is derived from the Greek word "botanēs", which means "herb, grass, or plant". The word botany is derived from the same Greek root, but it refers to the study of plants.

The word botanist was first recorded in English in the 16th century, and it referred to a person who studied plants for medicinal or scientific purposes. The word botany was first recorded in English in the 17th century, and it referred to the study of plants in general, including their classification, structure, and functions.

Over time, the meanings of both words have remained largely unchanged, although the study of botany has expanded to include the study of plant ecology, evolution, and genetics. Today, a botanist is a scientist who studies plants and a botanist is a person who practices botany.

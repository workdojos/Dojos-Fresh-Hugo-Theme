The word "brew" is derived from the Old English "breowan," which means "to prepare or make by boiling." The word "master" comes from the Old English "maegester," which means "a person who has control or authority over others."

The term "brew master" likely originated in the medieval period, when monks and other religious figures began brewing beer as a way to sustain themselves. These individuals would have been responsible for overseeing the brewing process and ensuring that the final product met certain standards of quality and purity.

As for the term "beer brewing," it is likely that this phrase has been in use since the ancient world. The process of brewing beer involves boiling water, adding grains (such as barley or wheat), and allowing the mixture to ferment. This process was likely developed by ancient civilizations as a way to preserve and consume grain, as well as to create a more palatable beverage.

Over time, the meaning of the term "brew master" has remained relatively constant, though it has come to be associated more with the professional brewing industry than with religious practice. The term "beer brewing" has also remained largely unchanged, though it has come to be associated more with the production of alcoholic beer than with any other type of beverage.

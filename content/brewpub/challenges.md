Many brewpubs struggle to differentiate themselves in a crowded market and may not have the resources to compete with larger companies. This can lead to financial struggles and the potential closure of small businesses. It is important for lawmakers and consumers to support small brewpubs and recognize the value they bring to the industry, including unique and local craft beer offerings and a sense of community.

In addition to regulatory and competitive challenges, many brewpub owners are struggling to find work and receive fair compensation for their efforts. Many brewpubs operate on thin profit margins and may not have the resources to pay their employees a living wage. It is important for consumers to understand the value of supporting small businesses and for lawmakers to consider policies that ensure small business owners are able to pay their employees a fair wage.

Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign to promote your new brew pub business:

Instagram: Create a visually appealing feed that showcases your brew pub's unique atmosphere, delicious food and drink offerings, and events. Use hashtags relevant to the brew pub industry and the local community to attract new followers. Consider hosting an Instagram takeover with a local food blogger or influencer to showcase your brew pub to their followers.

Twitter: Tweet about your brew pub's daily specials, events, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of your business. Use Twitter to interact with customers and offer exclusive deals to your followers. Consider participating in Twitter chats relevant to the brew pub industry to connect with other professionals and potential customers.

YouTube: Create a YouTube channel for your brew pub and post videos showcasing your brew pub's atmosphere, food and drink offerings, and events. Consider creating a series of videos featuring the brewing process or a behind-the-scenes look at your brew pub.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring your brew pub's food and drink offerings, events, and atmosphere. Use Pinterest to showcase your brew pub's unique atmosphere and culture to potential customers. Consider using Pinterest to promote special events or limited-time offerings.

As a career counselor, it is my job to help you explore your options and make informed decisions about your professional life. Based on your interest in becoming a cafe owner, I believe you have a strong passion for food and customer service. Here are some potential careers that might be a good fit for you, based on your skills, interests, and experience:

Cafe owner/manager: Running a cafe is a challenging but rewarding career that requires strong business skills and a passion for food and customer service. To be successful in this role, you will need to be able to manage a team, create menus, and handle the financial aspects of running a business. You will also need to be able to market your cafe and build a loyal customer base.

Food and beverage manager: If you are interested in working in the food and beverage industry but don't want to own your own cafe, you might consider becoming a food and beverage manager. This role involves overseeing the food and drink offerings at restaurants, hotels, and other venues. You will be responsible for managing budgets, developing menus, and ensuring that customers have a positive dining experience.

Barista: If you are passionate about coffee and want to work in a cafe setting, you might consider becoming a barista. As a barista, you will be responsible for preparing and serving coffee and other beverages to customers. You will need to have a strong knowledge of different types of coffee and be able to make a variety of drinks. You will also need to have excellent customer service skills.

Catering coordinator: If you are interested in working in the food and beverage industry but want more flexibility in your schedule, you might consider becoming a catering coordinator. This role involves organizing and managing catering events for clients. You will be responsible for developing menus, coordinating with vendors, and ensuring that all aspects of the event run smoothly.

In terms of qualifications, it is often helpful to have a degree in business, hospitality, or food and beverage management. However, you can also gain experience and knowledge through on-the-job training and industry-specific certifications. It is also important to keep up with trends in the cafe industry and continuously improve your skills and knowledge.

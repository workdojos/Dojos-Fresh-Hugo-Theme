Captain:

The word "captain" comes from the Latin word "capitaneus," which means "chief" or "leader." It was originally used to refer to a military officer or leader of a ship.

The word was first recorded in English in the 14th century, and it was used to refer to a person who had authority or command over others, especially in a military or naval context.

Over time, the meaning of the word "captain" has expanded to include other types of leaders, such as the captain of a sports team or the captain of an airline. It is now used more generally to refer to a person who is in charge of something or someone.

Transportation:

The word "transportation" comes from the Latin word "transportare," which means "to carry across" or "to convey." It was originally used to refer to the act of moving goods or people from one place to another, either by land, sea, or air.

The word was first recorded in English in the 16th century, and it was used to refer to the movement of goods or people by any means, including by horse, boat, or train.

Over time, the meaning of the word "transportation" has become more specialized, and it is now most commonly used to refer to the movement of goods or people by vehicle or mechanical means, such as cars, buses, or airplanes.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend considering the use of open-source technology for building your own website for a few reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization in the design and development process. You can choose from a variety of open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other popular open-source apps that offer a range of features and functionality, which can be tailored to meet the specific needs of your business and target audience.

Second, using open-source technology can also be more cost-effective compared to proprietary solutions. Many open-source tools and platforms offer a wide range of features and functionality at no cost, which can save you money on upfront and ongoing development costs.

Finally, open-source technology is often well-supported by a community of developers and users, which can provide valuable resources and support for troubleshooting and problem-solving during the development process.

Some of the leading open-source web builders and static-site generators that you may want to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, as well as tools like Gatsby, Next.js, and Hexo. Each of these options has its own pros and cons, and it will be important to carefully assess the specific needs of your business and target audience in order to determine the best fit.

Overall, using open-source technology can offer a range of benefits for building your own website, including greater flexibility, customization, and cost-effectiveness. However, it is important to also consider the potential drawbacks, including the need for technical expertise and the need to host and maintain your own website on your own server. It may be helpful to consult with a web design professional or seek out resources and guidance from the open-source community to help you make an informed decision.

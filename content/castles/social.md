Hi there! As a social media influencer, I am excited to help you promote your new business as a castle owner in the castle industry. Here are some ideas for an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest:

Instagram: Use Instagram's visual platform to showcase the stunning beauty of your castle. Use hashtags like #castles, #history, and #luxury to attract the right audience. Share behind-the-scenes photos and videos of your castle restoration process and make use of Instagram's Stories feature to give your followers a sneak peek into your daily life as a castle owner.

Twitter: Share interesting facts and history about your castle, as well as updates on your restoration progress. Use hashtags like #castles, #heritage, and #luxurytravel to reach a wider audience. Engage with other castle enthusiasts and industry professionals by retweeting and commenting on their content.

YouTube: Create a YouTube channel to document your castle restoration process and share stories about the history of your castle. Use video to showcase the unique features and beauty of your castle, and consider offering virtual tours or live streams to give your followers a closer look.

Pinterest: Create a Pinterest board dedicated to your castle and use it to curate inspiring images, quotes, and ideas related to castle living and luxury travel. Use relevant hashtags to make your pins discoverable, and engage with other Pinterest users by commenting and repinning their content.

I hope these ideas help you create an engaging social media campaign for your new business as a castle owner. Good luck!

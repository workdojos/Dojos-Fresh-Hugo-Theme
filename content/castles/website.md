As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

First and foremost, open-source technology is cost-effective. Many open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other apps are free to use, meaning you don't have to pay for expensive proprietary software licenses. This can save your business a significant amount of money, especially if you're just starting out and don't have a large budget for website development.

Additionally, open-source technology is highly customizable. Because the source code is available for anyone to view and modify, you have complete control over the design and functionality of your website. This allows you to tailor the site to your specific needs and business goals, rather than being limited by the constraints of a proprietary platform.

One of the leading open-source web builders is WordPress, which is used by millions of websites worldwide. WordPress is easy to use and offers a wide range of customizable themes and plugins, making it a great option for businesses of all sizes. Other popular open-source options include Joomla and Drupal.

Static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, are also a great option for building a website. These tools allow you to create a website using simple text files, rather than a traditional database-driven platform. This can be especially useful for businesses that need a simple, fast-loading website with minimal maintenance requirements.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your website has several benefits, including cost-effectiveness, customization, and simplicity. It's important to weigh the pros and cons of each option and consider your specific business needs before making a decision.

As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization in the development process. You can choose from a variety of open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other popular apps to create a website that meets your specific needs and goals.

Additionally, open-source technology is often more cost-effective compared to proprietary solutions. Many open-source tools and resources are free to use, while others may require a small fee. This can be a great option for small businesses or startups that are working with a limited budget.

In terms of building a chatbot-specific website, there are several open-source options to consider. Some popular choices include Botpress, Rasa, and ChatterBot. Each of these tools has its own set of features and capabilities, and it's important to carefully evaluate which one is the best fit for your business needs.

One potential drawback to using open-source technology is that you may not have access to the same level of support and resources as you would with a proprietary solution. However, the open-source community is typically very active and supportive, and there are often forums, documentation, and other resources available to help you troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your website far outweigh the potential drawbacks. By taking advantage of the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of open-source tools, you can create a high-quality website that meets your business goals and delivers a great user experience.

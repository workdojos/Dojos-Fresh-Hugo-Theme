Cinematographer: The word "cinematographer" comes from the Greek word "kinēma," meaning "movement," and the French word "photographe," meaning "photographer." The term was first used in the early 20th century to describe a person who was responsible for capturing and recording motion pictures on film.

Cinema: The word "cinema" also has roots in the Greek language, with "kinēma" as its base. It was originally used to describe a method of projecting motion pictures onto a screen, and has since come to refer to the industry and art form of film.

Over time, the meanings of both "cinematographer" and "cinema" have remained relatively unchanged. However, the technology and techniques used in the field have evolved significantly, leading to the development of new subcategories such as digital cinematography and special effects cinematography.

It will also test the platform with a small group of users to gather feedback and make any necessary adjustments before launching to the wider market.

Estimated 1st Year Cost of Operation: $500,000, including development, marketing, employee salaries, and hosting and maintenance costs.

Potential Business Challenges: Competition from other platforms or resources for cinematographers, difficulty in acquiring and retaining users, and the need to continuously update and improve the platform to meet the needs of users.

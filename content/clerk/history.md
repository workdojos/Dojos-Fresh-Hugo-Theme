The word "clerk" comes from the Old English word "clerc," which comes from the Latin "clericus," meaning "clergyman." It originally referred to a person who was ordained in the Christian Church, but over time it came to refer to any person who performed writing or administrative tasks, especially in a business or office setting.

The word "small business" is a more recent term that has evolved with the development of capitalism and the growth of commerce. It refers to a business that is privately owned and operated and typically has fewer employees and a smaller scale of operation compared to larger, more established companies. The meaning of the word "small" in this context refers to the size or scope of the business, rather than its importance or value.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons.

First, using open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization. With open-source web builders and static-site generators, you have access to the source code and can modify it to fit your specific needs and preferences. This is particularly useful if you have specific requirements or features that you want to incorporate into your website.

Second, open-source technology is often more cost-effective compared to proprietary solutions. Many open-source web builders and static-site generators are free to use, and if you choose to host your website on your own server, you can potentially save on hosting fees.

Third, open-source technology is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, which means that you can benefit from the collective knowledge and expertise of this community. This can be particularly useful if you encounter any issues or have questions about the development process.

Some of the leading open-source web builders and static-site generators that you may want to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and customization options and are suitable for a variety of different website types.

There are also several popular open-source apps that you may want to consider, including content management systems (CMS) such as WordPress and Joomla, and e-commerce platforms such as Magento and OpenCart. These apps can provide additional functionality and features that can enhance the overall user experience of your website.

There are, however, also some potential downsides to using open-source technology. One of the main drawbacks is that you may need to have some technical knowledge and skills in order to effectively use and customize these platforms. Additionally, you may need to invest time and resources into maintaining and updating your website, particularly if you choose to host it on your own server.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can offer a range of benefits, including greater flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and access to a supportive community. However, it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons and costs of each solution before making a decision.

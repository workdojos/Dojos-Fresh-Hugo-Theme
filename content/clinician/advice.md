As a career counselor, it is my job to help individuals like yourself determine the best career path for their skills, interests, and experience. Based on your desire to pursue a career as a clinician working in the medical industry, I have conducted some research and gathered some information that may be helpful in your decision-making process.

First, it is important to consider your qualifications and experience in the medical field. Becoming a clinician typically requires a bachelor's degree in a related field, such as nursing or medicine, as well as additional training and certification. It is also beneficial to have experience working in healthcare, either through internships or part-time jobs, as this can help you gain valuable skills and knowledge that will be useful in your career.

In terms of job market trends, the medical industry is expected to see significant growth in the coming years, particularly in the areas of healthcare administration and support roles. This means that there will be a demand for qualified individuals with the right skills and experience to fill these positions.

As for specific career options within the medical industry, some potential options for clinicians include becoming a nurse, a doctor, a physician assistant, or a physical therapist. Each of these careers requires different levels of education and training, and it is important to consider which path is the best fit for your interests and goals.

In summary, a career as a clinician in the medical industry is a rewarding and challenging path that requires a strong commitment to education and training. With the right qualifications and experience, you can find a fulfilling career in this exciting and growing industry.

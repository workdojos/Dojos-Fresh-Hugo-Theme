As a social media manager for your medical organization, I would recommend the following strategies:

Twitter:
Utilize hashtags related to the medical industry to increase visibility and reach new followers
Share informative and engaging content about your organization, such as news updates, educational resources, and patient testimonials
Use Twitter chats to engage with other medical professionals and organizations
Monitor and respond to questions and comments from followers in a timely manner
Instagram:
Use visually appealing photos and graphics to showcase your organization and its services
Share behind-the-scenes glimpses of your organization to give followers a more personal look into your work
Utilize Instagram stories to share updates, patient testimonials, and other engaging content
Collaborate with other medical organizations or influencers by using Instagram takeovers or sponsored posts
Pinterest:
Create boards related to the medical industry, such as health and wellness tips, medical resources, and patient testimonials
Utilize Pinterest analytics to track the success of your pins and see what content is resonating with followers
Use Pinterest to drive traffic to your website by including links to your content in your pins
Overall, my goal as a social media manager for your medical organization would be to increase brand awareness, recruit followers, drive traffic to your website, and increase conversions through engaging and informative content across all platforms. I would also work to create opportunities for collaboration with other medical professionals and organizations in order to build relationships and increase the reach of your brand.

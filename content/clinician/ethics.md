As a philosopher, I would approach this question by considering the various ethical theories that have been proposed by philosophers throughout history. These theories include deontology, which holds that moral actions should be guided by rules or duties, and utilitarianism, which holds that the greatest good for the greatest number of people should be the guiding principle for moral actions.

I would also consider the specific ethical dilemmas that clinicians may face in the medical industry, such as conflicts of interest, informed consent, and end-of-life decision-making. In order to develop an ethical framework for clinicians, it may be necessary to consider these specific issues and determine how they can be addressed within the larger ethical framework being proposed.

One potential solution may be to adopt a hybrid approach that combines elements of deontology and utilitarianism. For example, a clinician may consider the duty to respect the autonomy of their patients and the principle of non-maleficence, while also considering the potential benefits or harms that their actions may have for the patient and society as a whole.

Ultimately, the ethical framework for clinicians should prioritize the well-being of their patients and respect for their autonomy, while also considering the broader impacts of their actions on society. It may also be necessary to consider the ethical implications of new technologies and advancements in the medical industry, and to continually reassess and adjust the ethical framework as needed.

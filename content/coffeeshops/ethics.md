As a philosopher, I would suggest starting with considering the fundamental principles of ethical theory. This could involve looking at deontological approaches, which emphasize the inherent moral value of certain actions, or consequentialist approaches, which focus on the consequences of actions for determining their moral value.

From there, it may be helpful to consider the specific ethical considerations that may arise in the coffee shop industry. For example, you may want to think about issues such as fair treatment of employees, sustainability and environmental responsibility, and the ethical implications of sourcing and selling coffee beans.

In developing your ethical framework, it may also be useful to consider the perspectives of stakeholders such as employees, customers, and the wider community. You may want to consider how your actions as a coffee shop owner will impact these groups and how you can balance their interests in an ethical manner.

Ultimately, the goal of an ethical framework is to provide guidance and direction in decision-making and to ensure that the actions of the coffee shop are consistent with your own personal values and moral beliefs. It may be helpful to continually revisit and revise your ethical framework as you gain more experience and insights in your career as a coffee shop owner.

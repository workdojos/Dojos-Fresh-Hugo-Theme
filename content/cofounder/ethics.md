As a philosopher, I would first consider what ethical frameworks have already been proposed within the field of business. One common framework is the shareholder theory, which holds that the primary ethical duty of a business is to maximize profits for its shareholders. However, this theory has been criticized for prioritizing financial gain over the well-being of other stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and the community.

Another framework to consider is the stakeholder theory, which holds that a business has a duty to consider the interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. This theory recognizes that businesses have a social responsibility to contribute to the common good and to act in a way that benefits the community and environment.

In developing an ethical framework for a career as a cofounder in the startup services industry, it might be helpful to consider the impact that your business will have on various stakeholders. For example, how will your business impact your employees, customers, suppliers, and the community? How will your business contribute to the common good and the greater social good?

One potential framework for guiding ethical decision-making in this context might be a combination of the stakeholder theory and the principle of beneficence, which holds that one has a duty to do good and to prevent harm. This framework would require considering the interests and well-being of all stakeholders, as well as actively seeking ways to contribute to the common good and to prevent harm to people and the environment.

Ultimately, the ethical framework that you develop will depend on your own values and the specific context of your business. It may be helpful to consult with other philosophers or ethicists to further explore these concepts and develop a framework that aligns with your goals and values as a cofounder in the startup services industry.

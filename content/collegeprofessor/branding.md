Sure, I can definitely help with that. Here are some steps I would take as a social media manager for your higher education organization:

Research and identify target audience: In order to effectively reach and engage with potential followers, it's important to understand who your target audience is and what platforms they are most active on. This may include current or prospective students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

Develop a content calendar: Plan out a schedule for posting on each platform, including a mix of promotional content, educational resources, and engagement-driven content (e.g. polls, Q&A sessions). Be sure to also consider any relevant events or holidays that may influence your content strategy.

Create engaging content: Utilize a variety of mediums, such as photos, videos, infographics, and text-based posts, to keep followers interested and engaged. Consider using hashtags related to your industry and higher education in general to reach a wider audience.

Monitor and respond to comments and questions: Use community management tools to keep track of mentions and interactions on your social media channels. Be sure to respond promptly to any questions or comments, and address any negative feedback in a professional and helpful manner.

Measure success: Use analytics tools to track key metrics such as follower growth, website traffic, and conversion rates. Use this data to refine your strategy and identify what content is most effective at achieving your goals.

Seek out collaborations: Look for opportunities to collaborate with other higher education institutions or organizations in your industry. This can help increase brand awareness and reach a larger audience.

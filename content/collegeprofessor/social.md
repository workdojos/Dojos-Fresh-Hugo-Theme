Instagram: Create a series of Instagram posts showcasing your teaching style and the subject matter you specialize in. Use hashtags related to higher education and teaching, and tag relevant accounts such as colleges and universities, educational organizations, and other educators. Engage with your followers by asking for their thoughts on education and inviting them to share their own experiences.

Pinterest: Create a Pinterest board dedicated to education-related content and resources. Pin your own content, as well as content from other educators and higher education institutions.

The word committee has its origins in the Latin word "committere," which means "to commit or entrust." This word was eventually adopted into Middle English in the 14th century and was used to describe a group of people who were entrusted with a specific task or responsibility.

Over time, the meaning of the word committee has evolved to refer specifically to a group of people who are appointed or elected to work together on a specific issue or task. In modern usage, committees are often found within governmental or organizational structures and are responsible for making decisions or recommendations on a variety of issues.

The word self-governance also has its roots in Latin, with the word "self" coming from the Latin "sÄ“" meaning "oneself" and "governance" coming from the Latin "gubernare," meaning "to steer or guide." The term self-governance was first recorded in English in the 16th century and was used to describe a system of government in which a group or community is responsible for governing itself without the intervention of external authority.

Over time, the meaning of self-governance has evolved to refer to the ability of an individual or group to exercise control or authority over their own affairs without interference from external sources. In modern usage, self-governance is often associated with the concept of autonomy or independence.

Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign to promote your new business in the self-governance industry:

Instagram: Create a series of visually stunning and informative posts about your business and the self-governance industry. Use hashtags relevant to your industry and include calls to action in your captions, such as "Learn more about self-governance by following our page" or "Join our mailing list to stay up to date on the latest in self-governance".

Twitter: Tweet about your business and the self-governance industry on a regular basis, using relevant hashtags and tagging other industry experts and influencers. Engage with followers by asking questions, sharing news and articles, and responding to comments.

YouTube: Create a YouTube channel and post videos about your business and the self-governance industry. These could be interviews with industry experts, educational videos on self-governance topics, or promotional videos about your business.

Pinterest: Create boards on Pinterest with relevant pins about your business and the self-governance industry. This could include infographics, articles, and images related to self-governance. Engage with followers by commenting on their pins and repinning their content to your boards.

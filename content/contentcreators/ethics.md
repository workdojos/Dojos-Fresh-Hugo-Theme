As a philosopher, one approach to developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a content creator would be to consider the role that one's work plays in shaping the beliefs and values of their audience. This might involve reflecting on the ways in which one's content might influence public opinion, or the ways in which it might shape cultural norms and values.

One approach to this might be to consider the concept of moral responsibility, which suggests that individuals have a duty to act in ways that are consistent with their values and beliefs. In the context of content creation, this could involve considering the ways in which one's work might contribute to the betterment of society, or the ways in which it might have a negative impact.

Another approach might be to consider the concept of social justice, which suggests that individuals have a responsibility to promote fairness and equality in society. This could involve thinking about the ways in which one's work might help to promote greater understanding and acceptance of marginalized groups, or the ways in which it might contribute to the maintenance of oppressive power structures.

Ultimately, developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a content creator will likely involve a combination of these and other philosophical ideas, as well as a deep reflection on one's own values and beliefs. By engaging in this process, one can develop a set of guiding principles that will help them to create content that is meaningful, impactful, and ethical.

As the social media manager for your journalism organization, I would first recommend conducting a thorough analysis of your current social media presence. This includes analyzing your current followers, engagement rates, and the type of content that performs well. This will help us to understand what is working well and what areas we can improve upon.

Next, I would suggest creating a content calendar that outlines the type of content we will be posting on each platform and when. This could include industry news, behind-the-scenes looks at your organization, and promotional content.

To increase brand awareness, I would recommend utilizing hashtags relevant to your industry and participating in Twitter chats and Instagram challenges. We can also collaborate with other journalists and organizations to reach a wider audience and establish ourselves as thought leaders in the industry.

In order to drive traffic to your website, we can include links to articles and resources on your website in our social media posts and utilize Instagram and Pinterest to showcase your organization's content visually.

To increase conversion, we can utilize social media advertising and retargeting to reach potential customers and drive them to specific landing pages on your website.

Overall, the key to success on social media for a journalism organization is to consistently create and share engaging content, participate in relevant conversations, and utilize analytics to measure and improve upon our strategies.

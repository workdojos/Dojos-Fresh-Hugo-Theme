Correspondent:
The word correspondent comes from the Latin word correspondere, which means "to correspond." It was first used in English in the 16th century to describe someone who communicates with someone else, especially through letters or other forms of written communication.

Over time, the meaning of the word has evolved to refer specifically to a person who reports on events or news for a media organization, often from a remote location. This use of the word corresponds to the modern meaning of "journalism," which is the practice of collecting, writing, and reporting news.

Journalism:
The word journalism comes from the French word journalisme, which was derived from the Latin word diurnalis, meaning "of the day." It was first used in English in the early 19th century to describe the profession of reporting and writing news for newspapers, magazines, or other media outlets.

The meaning of the word has remained relatively constant over time, although the ways in which journalism is practiced and the media through which it is disseminated have changed significantly with advances in technology. Today, journalism encompasses not only traditional print and broadcast media, but also digital and online platforms, as well as social media and other forms of citizen journalism.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization in the design and development process. As a journalist, you may have specific needs for your website that can be more easily met through the use of open-source tools.

Second, open-source technology often has a strong community of developers and users who are constantly working to improve and update the software. This means that you can benefit from the collective knowledge and experience of this community as you build and maintain your website.

There are many popular open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other tools that can be used to create a great user experience for your website. Some of the leading options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which offer a wide range of features and customization options.

However, it's important to consider the pros and cons of each option before making a decision. WordPress, for example, is a popular choice for many businesses due to its ease of use and wide range of themes and plugins. However, it can also require more maintenance and updates to keep it secure and running smoothly.

Overall, the costs of using open-source technology will depend on the specific tools and resources you choose to use. Many open-source options are free to use, but you may need to pay for certain plugins or premium features. It's important to carefully consider your budget and needs before making a decision.

In summary, using open-source technology to build your website can offer greater flexibility and customization, as well as the support of a strong community. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option and the costs involved before making a decision.

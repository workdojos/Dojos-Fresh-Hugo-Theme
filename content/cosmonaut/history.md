The word cosmonaut comes from the Russian word "космонавт," which means "sailor of the universe." The word was coined in the early 20th century as a way to describe the astronauts who were being trained by the Soviet Union to explore outer space. The word was first used in English in the late 1950s, when the Soviet Union launched its first manned spacecraft, the Sputnik 1.

The word space comes from the Latin word "spatium," which means "room" or "distance." The word has been in use in English since the 14th century, and originally referred to the physical distance between objects. Over time, the word has come to be associated with outer space and the cosmos, and is now often used to refer to the vast expanse beyond the Earth's atmosphere.

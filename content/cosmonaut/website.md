As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few key reasons.

Firstly, open-source technology is free to use, which can be a significant cost-saving measure for your business. It also allows you to have complete control over the source code and customization of your website, as opposed to using a proprietary platform where you are limited in what you can do with the code.

In terms of creating a website for a business in the space industry, there are several open-source options that would be suitable. Some popular open-source web builders include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of templates and plugins to help you create a professional-looking website quickly and easily.

Static-site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo are also great options for creating a website for a business in the space industry. These platforms allow you to create a fast-loading, scalable website that is easy to manage and maintain.

Other popular open-source apps that could enhance the user experience of your website include Google Maps for displaying location information, and social media integrations such as Twitter and Facebook to allow users to share content from your website.

It's important to also consider the pros and cons of using open-source technology. One pro is the cost-saving aspect mentioned earlier, as well as the ability to customize and control the source code. However, it may require more technical knowledge and resources to manage and maintain the website, as opposed to using a proprietary platform with more support and resources available.

In terms of costs, the initial cost of using open-source technology is free, but there may be costs associated with hosting the website and any additional plugins or templates you choose to use. It's important to weigh these costs against the benefits and determine the most cost-effective solution for your business.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can be a great option for businesses looking to have complete control and customization over their website, while also potentially saving on costs. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons and costs associated with using open-source technology, as well as the specific needs of your business, in order to determine the best solution for your website.

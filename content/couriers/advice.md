As a career counselor, it is my job to help individuals like yourself determine the best career path for your skills, interests, and experience. In order to provide you with the most accurate and helpful guidance, I will need to ask you a few questions to get a better understanding of your strengths and goals.

Firstly, let's discuss your skills and experience. Do you have any relevant experience working in the supply-chain industry or in a similar field? This could include experience in logistics, transportation, or customer service. Additionally, do you have any specific skills or qualifications that may be relevant to this field, such as a valid driver's license or experience operating delivery vehicles?

Next, let's consider your interests. Do you enjoy working independently and being on the go, or do you prefer a more structured work environment? Are you comfortable working with a team and communicating with clients or customers? Understanding your personal preferences can help us determine if a career as a courier is a good fit for you.

Now, let's research the job market trends in the supply-chain industry. According to recent data, the demand for couriers and delivery drivers is expected to grow by 10% over the next decade, which is faster than the average for all occupations. However, competition for these roles may be strong, especially in urban areas where there are more delivery services and companies.

To increase your chances of success in this field, it may be helpful to pursue certain qualifications or certifications. For example, obtaining a commercial driver's license (CDL) or taking a course in logistics or transportation management could give you a competitive edge in the job market.

In conclusion, a career as a courier working in the supply-chain industry could be a great fit for you if you have relevant skills and experience, enjoy working independently, and are comfortable interacting with customers. To increase your chances of success in this field, it may be helpful to pursue relevant qualifications or certifications. I hope this guidance has been helpful and wish you the best of luck in your career journey.

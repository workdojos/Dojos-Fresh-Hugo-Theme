As a social media manager, I would recommend the following strategies for managing the presence of your supply-chain organization on Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest:

Twitter:
Utilize hashtags related to the supply-chain industry in your tweets to increase visibility and reach a larger audience
Use Twitter analytics to track the success of your tweets and make any necessary adjustments to improve engagement
Engage with other industry professionals and organizations by commenting, retweeting, and following them
Share valuable content such as industry news, articles, and tips to attract and retain followers
Instagram:
Utilize Instagram's visual platform to showcase the products and services offered by your supply-chain organization
Utilize Instagram's tagging and location features to increase visibility and reach a larger audience
Engage with your followers by responding to comments and likes and posting regularly
Share behind-the-scenes content such as office and warehouse tours to give your followers a glimpse into your organization's culture and operations
Pinterest:
Utilize Pinterest's visual platform to share infographics, diagrams, and other visual content related to the supply-chain industry
Utilize Pinterest's boards to organize your content and make it easy for your followers to find what they're looking for
Engage with your followers by commenting on and repinning their content
Share valuable content such as industry news, articles, and tips to attract and retain followers

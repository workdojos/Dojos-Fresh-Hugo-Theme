As a philosopher, one might consider several different approaches to developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a courier working in the supply-chain industry. Some potential options might include:

Utilitarianism: This approach would focus on the greatest good for the greatest number, and thus might emphasize the importance of ensuring that the supply-chain industry operates efficiently and effectively, in order to maximize the benefits to society as a whole.

Kantian ethics: This approach would focus on the importance of acting in accordance with moral rules and principles, and might emphasize the importance of honesty, integrity, and respect for others in the supply-chain industry.

Rawlsian justice: This approach would focus on the principles of justice and fairness, and might emphasize the importance of ensuring that all members of the supply-chain industry are treated fairly and justly, regardless of their individual circumstances.

Virtues ethics: This approach would focus on the development of virtues and good character, and might emphasize the importance of cultivating virtues such as honesty, integrity, and compassion in the supply-chain industry.

Ultimately, the choice of ethical framework will depend on the individual's values and priorities, as well as the specific context and challenges faced by the supply-chain industry. However, by considering these different approaches and reflecting on their strengths and limitations, one can hopefully arrive at a well-reasoned and well-informed ethical framework for starting a career as a courier in the supply-chain industry.

Courier:

The word "courier" comes from the Latin word "currere," which means "to run." In ancient Rome, messengers were often sent to deliver important messages and documents, and they were called "cursores," or "runners." These messengers were often also soldiers or slaves who were trained to run quickly and deliver messages with great speed and efficiency.

The modern meaning of the word "courier" has evolved to refer to a person or service that transports goods, documents, or other items from one place to another, often over long distances. This could include mail carriers, delivery drivers, or logistics professionals who coordinate the transportation of goods within a supply chain.

Supply-chain:

The term "supply-chain" is a relatively recent coinage, dating back to the mid-20th century. It is derived from the phrase "supply chain management," which refers to the process of coordinating the flow of materials, information, and finances from suppliers to manufacturers to customers in a seamless and efficient manner.

The concept of supply-chain management has its roots in military logistics, where it was used to ensure the timely and efficient delivery of supplies to troops on the front lines. In the modern business world, the term "supply-chain" is used to refer to the entire network of organizations, people, activities, and resources involved in the production, distribution, and delivery of goods and services. This includes everything from raw materials and components, to transportation, warehousing, and distribution.

Over time, the meaning of the term "supply-chain" has evolved to encompass not just the physical movement of goods, but also the management of information and data related to those goods. With the increasing use of technology in logistics and supply-chain management, the term now often includes the use of computer systems and data analytics to track and optimize the flow of goods and information within a supply chain.

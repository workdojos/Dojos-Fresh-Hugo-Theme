As a philosopher, one approach to developing an ethical framework for a career as a curator in the art curation industry would be to consider the principles of deontological ethics. This approach emphasizes the importance of fulfilling moral duties and obligations, regardless of the consequences.

In the context of art curation, one might argue that the primary duty of a curator is to safeguard and promote the cultural and historical significance of the artworks in their care. This might involve upholding standards of conservation and preservation, as well as ensuring that the works are presented in a way that is both aesthetically pleasing and intellectually stimulating to audiences.

Additionally, a deontological approach might emphasize the importance of acting with integrity and honesty in all aspects of one's work as a curator. This could involve being transparent about any conflicts of interest that may arise, as well as avoiding any actions that could be perceived as self-serving or motivated by personal gain.

Finally, a deontological ethical framework might also require curators to consider the broader societal impact of their work. For example, curators might be expected to consider the ethical implications of exhibiting works of art that may be controversial or offensive to some members of the public. In these cases, it might be necessary to balance the duty to preserve and promote cultural heritage with the duty to respect the values and beliefs of others.

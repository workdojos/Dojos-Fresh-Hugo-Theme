The word "curator" comes from the Latin word "curare," meaning "to care for." In ancient Rome, a curator was a financial officer or manager who was responsible for the care and management of public property or finances.

The modern meaning of the word "curator" refers to someone who is responsible for the care and management of a museum, art gallery, or other collection. The role of a curator involves selecting, acquiring, and displaying items in the collection, as well as researching and interpreting them for the public.

The word "art curation" refers to the process of selecting, organizing, and presenting artworks in a specific context, such as in a museum or gallery. The term "curation" has become more common in recent years, as the role of curators has evolved to include more emphasis on curating exhibitions and collections that are meaningful and relevant to contemporary audiences.

Overall, the meanings of "curator" and "art curation" have evolved over time to reflect the changing roles and responsibilities of those who care for and present art and cultural artifacts.

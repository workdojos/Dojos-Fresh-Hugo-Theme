As a curator, it is important to have a strong background in art history, museum studies, and/or cultural studies. It would be helpful to have a degree in one of these fields and to have completed relevant coursework or internships. In terms of resources for learning more about the role of a curator, some of the best websites to check out include the American Alliance of Museums, the Association of Art Museum Curators, and the International Council of Museums.

Some of the best companies to work for as a curator include major museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art. These institutions offer exciting roles and responsibilities for curators, including the opportunity to research and acquire new artworks, to develop exhibitions, and to engage with the public through educational programs and events.

Some helpful tips and tricks for aspiring curators include networking with professionals in the field, staying up-to-date on current trends and exhibitions, and developing strong research and writing skills. Additionally, candidates for curator positions should be able to demonstrate their passion for and knowledge of art and culture, as well as their ability to work independently and collaboratively.

In an interview for a curator position, candidates should be prepared to answer questions about their education and experience, as well as their vision for curating exhibitions and engaging with the public. Some potential questions include:

What inspired you to pursue a career as a curator?
Can you discuss a specific exhibition or project you have worked on in the past?
How do you approach researching and acquiring artworks for an exhibition?
How do you envision engaging with the public through your curatorial work?
Can you discuss any challenges you have faced in your previous curatorial roles, and how you overcame them?

Sure, I'd be happy to help you create an engaging social media campaign to promote your new business as an art curator! Here are some ideas for content that you could post on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest:

Instagram: You could post visually stunning photos of your curated art exhibitions or installations, along with captions that provide context and background information about the artists and their work. You could also use Instagram stories to give your followers a behind-the-scenes look at your curation process and share sneak peeks of upcoming exhibitions.

Twitter: You could use Twitter to share updates about your business, such as upcoming exhibitions, new artists you're working with, or any special events or talks that you're participating in. You could also use Twitter to engage with other art curators, artists, and art enthusiasts, by tweeting about topics that you're passionate about and asking for feedback or opinions.

YouTube: You could create short videos that showcase your curated exhibitions or installations, providing your followers with a more immersive look at the art that you're curating. You could also create educational videos that provide insights into the art curation industry, or interviews with artists that you're working with.

Pinterest: You could create Pinterest boards that feature your curated art exhibitions or installations, as well as boards that showcase the work of artists that you admire or that you're planning to work with in the future. You could also use Pinterest to inspire your followers by creating boards that feature art-themed travel destinations, home decor ideas, or creative gift ideas.

Overall, the key to creating an engaging social media campaign is to mix up your content and provide value to your followers. By sharing a variety of photos, videos, and updates, and engaging with your followers through comments and replies, you can build a loyal and engaged following that will help you promote your business as an art curator.

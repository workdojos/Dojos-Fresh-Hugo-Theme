As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few key reasons.

First, open-source technology is generally free to use, which can be a significant cost advantage for your business. While there may be some costs associated with hosting and maintaining a website, the initial development costs are usually much lower when using open-source tools.

Second, open-source technology often has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the project, which means that there are often frequent updates and improvements. This can lead to a more stable and well-supported platform for your website.

Third, open-source technology tends to be highly customizable, which is important for businesses in the art curation industry where the design and aesthetic of the website is often a key factor in attracting and retaining customers.

Some popular open-source web builders that you may want to consider for your business include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. Static-site generators like Jekyll and Gatsby are also popular choices for building websites, and offer the added benefit of being able to deploy the site on your own server.

There are also a number of open-source apps that can be used to enhance the overall user experience of your website, such as social media integration, e-commerce functionality, and content management systems.

While there are many benefits to using open-source technology, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks as well. One potential disadvantage is that you may need to invest more time and resources into learning how to use the tools and customize them to meet your specific needs. Additionally, while the open-source community is generally very supportive, it may not always be as responsive as a paid support team.

Overall, I believe that the benefits of using open-source technology to build your website far outweigh the potential drawbacks, and can be a cost-effective and customizable solution for your business in the art curation industry.

As a philosopher, I would suggest that an ethical framework for starting a career as a data scientist should be grounded in a few key principles.

First, it is important to recognize that data science has the potential to have significant impact on society. Data scientists have the ability to shape the way that organizations and governments make decisions, and this power comes with a responsibility to use it ethically. This means that data scientists should be mindful of the potential consequences of their work, and should strive to use their skills in ways that benefit society rather than causing harm.

Second, data scientists should be transparent about their methods and findings. This includes being open about the sources of their data, the algorithms they use to analyze it, and the limitations of their analyses. Being transparent allows others to understand and verify the work of data scientists, and helps to ensure that their findings are accurate and unbiased.

Third, data scientists should respect the privacy and autonomy of individuals. This means that they should be careful to protect the personal information of those whose data they are working with, and should seek consent when appropriate. It also means that they should be mindful of the ways in which their work may influence the decisions and actions of others, and should strive to avoid manipulating or coercing people in unethical ways.

Overall, an ethical framework for data science should prioritize transparency, responsibility, and respect for individuals. By following these principles, data scientists can ensure that their work is ethical and contributes positively to society.

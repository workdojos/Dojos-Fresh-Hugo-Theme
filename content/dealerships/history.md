The word "dealership" is a relatively recent term, having only been in use since the early 20th century. It is derived from the word "deal," which comes from the Old English word "dæl," meaning "portion, part, share, lot." The word "dealer" has a similar etymology, with the Old English root "dæl" being the basis for the modern word.

The term "dealership owner" refers to the person who owns and operates a dealership, a place where vehicles, typically cars, are bought and sold. The word "dealership" is a combination of the words "deal" and "ship," which in this context refers to a place of business. The word "owner," on the other hand, comes from the Old English word "egere," meaning "heir, descendant, possessor."

The word "car dealer" refers to a person who sells cars, either at a dealership or as an independent seller. The word "car" is derived from the Latin word "carrus," meaning "wheeled vehicle," and the word "dealer" has already been explained above.

Over time, the meanings of these words have remained relatively constant, with minor variations in usage. For example, the term "dealership owner" may also be used to refer to the owner of a dealership that sells other types of products or services, such as boats or motorcycles. Similarly, the term "car dealer" may also be used to refer to someone who sells used cars or specialty vehicles, such as classic or exotic cars.

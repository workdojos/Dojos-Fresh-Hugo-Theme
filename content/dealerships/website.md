As a web design consultant, I would recommend considering the use of open-source technology to build your dealership website for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, open-source technology is free to use and modify, which can significantly reduce the overall cost of building and maintaining your website. Additionally, open-source technologies often have a large community of developers contributing to and improving their functionality, which can lead to more stable and reliable platforms.

Some popular open-source web builders for building a business website include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a range of customizable templates and plugins to help you create a professional and functional website with minimal coding experience.

Static-site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo are also a great option for building a website, as they generate static HTML files that can be easily hosted on your own server. This can result in faster loading times and more security compared to traditional dynamic websites.

Other popular open-source apps that can enhance the user experience on your dealership website include chat tools like Slack and customer relationship management platforms like Salesforce.

However, it's important to also consider the potential drawbacks of using open-source technology. While open-source platforms can be highly customizable, they may require a greater level of technical expertise to set up and maintain compared to proprietary software. Additionally, open-source platforms may not offer the same level of support and resources as proprietary software.

Overall, the use of open-source technology can be a cost-effective and reliable solution for building a website for your dealership, as long as you are prepared to invest the time and resources into learning and maintaining the platform.

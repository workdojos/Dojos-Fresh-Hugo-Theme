As a philosopher, one approach to developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a digital marketer could involve examining the principles of deontological ethics. Deontological ethics is a moral theory that focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions, regardless of their consequences.

In the context of digital marketing, a deontological approach could involve examining the inherent moral value of certain marketing practices, such as using manipulative or deceptive techniques to influence consumer behavior. This approach would emphasize the importance of acting in accordance with moral duties and obligations, rather than solely considering the outcomes of one's actions.

Another approach could involve exploring the principles of consequentialism, which is a moral theory that holds that the consequences of an action are the ultimate basis for any moral judgment about that action. In this case, a digital marketer could consider the potential long-term effects of their marketing efforts on the well-being of their customers and the larger society.

Ultimately, the development of an ethical framework for a career in digital marketing will likely involve a combination of these and other philosophical approaches, as well as a consideration of the specific values and goals of the individual marketer and the company they work for.

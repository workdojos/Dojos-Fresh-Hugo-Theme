Sure, I can definitely help with that! Here are a few ideas for an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest to promote your new business as a digital marketer:

Instagram: Create a visually appealing Instagram feed that showcases your skills as a digital marketer. Share before and after examples of your work, testimonials from happy clients, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of your day-to-day work. Use hashtags related to digital marketing and engage with other influencers in the industry.

Twitter: Share short, concise tips and insights about digital marketing on Twitter. Use Twitter chats and participate in industry conversations to increase your visibility and establish yourself as an expert in the field.

YouTube: Create a YouTube channel and share tutorials, case studies, and Q&A sessions about digital marketing. Collaborate with other influencers in the industry and offer valuable content to your followers.

Pinterest: Create a Pinterest board specifically for digital marketing tips and resources. Pin relevant articles, infographics, and other useful content to your board and share it with your followers.

Overall, the key to a successful social media campaign is to consistently create valuable and engaging content, and to actively engage with your followers and other influencers in the industry. Good luck with your new business!

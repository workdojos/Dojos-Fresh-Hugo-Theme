The word "diner" is derived from the French word "dîner," which means "dinner." The word "dîner" itself is derived from the Latin word "disjejunare," which means "to break one's fast." In modern English, the word "diner" refers to a small, informal restaurant that serves meals throughout the day, often with a counter and booths.

The word "restaurant" also has roots in the French language, coming from the word "restaurer," which means "to restore." This word was originally used to describe a place where one could go to have their health restored through food and drink. In modern English, the word "restaurant" refers to a place where one can go to purchase and consume prepared meals.

The meanings of both words have evolved over time, with "diner" becoming more closely associated with a specific type of casual dining establishment and "restaurant" being used to refer to a wider variety of dining establishments, including formal and upscale ones.

First of all, congratulations on your new business! As a social media influencer, I have a few ideas for how to promote your diner on various platforms:

Instagram:
Create visually appealing posts showcasing your dishes and the ambiance of your diner. Use hashtags related to the restaurant industry, food, and your location to reach a wider audience.
Share behind-the-scenes content, such as cooking videos or photos of your team preparing food in the kitchen. This helps to give your followers a more personal look at your business and creates a sense of authenticity.
Collaborate with other local businesses or food influencers in your area to cross-promote each other and reach a larger audience.
Utilize Instagram stories to share daily specials, new menu items, or any events or promotions you have going on.
Twitter:
Tweet updates about your diner, such as daily specials or any events you have coming up.
Share photos of your dishes and the atmosphere of your restaurant to entice followers to come and visit.
Interact with your followers by responding to their tweets and retweeting content that is relevant to your business.
Utilize hashtags related to the restaurant industry and your location to help your tweets reach a wider audience.
YouTube:
Create a YouTube channel for your diner and post videos showcasing your dishes and the atmosphere of your restaurant.
Share cooking videos or behind-the-scenes content to give followers a more personal look at your business.
Utilize YouTube's search function by using relevant keywords in your video titles and descriptions to help your videos rank higher in search results.
Pinterest:
Create boards featuring your dishes, the atmosphere of your restaurant, and any events or promotions you have going on.
Share your pins on Twitter and Instagram to drive traffic to your Pinterest account.
Utilize relevant hashtags in your pin descriptions to help your content reach a wider audience.
I hope these suggestions help you create an engaging campaign to promote your diner on social media! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

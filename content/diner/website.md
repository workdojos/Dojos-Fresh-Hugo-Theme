As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for a more flexible and customizable website, as you have access to the source code and can make changes or updates as needed. This can be particularly useful for a business owner in the restaurant industry, as you may want to regularly update menus, specials, or other information on your website.

In terms of open-source web builders, some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and tools for creating and managing a website, including templates, plugins, and integrations with other tools such as e-commerce platforms.

Static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, are another option for building a website. These tools allow you to create a static website, which is faster and more secure than a dynamic website, but may not offer as much flexibility in terms of updates and changes.

Other open-source apps that may be useful for a restaurant website include reservation systems, menu management tools, and online ordering platforms.

One potential benefit of using open-source technology is the lower cost compared to proprietary solutions. However, it is important to consider the resources required for maintenance and updates, as well as any potential costs for customizations or additional features.

Overall, the best solution will depend on the specific needs and goals of your business, and it may be helpful to consult with a web development professional to determine the most suitable options.

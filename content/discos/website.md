As a web design consultant, I would recommend considering open-source technology for building your website for a few reasons. First, open-source technology is generally free to use, which can be a cost-effective solution for your business. Additionally, open-source technology often has a large community of developers and users, which means there is often a wealth of resources available for support and troubleshooting.

There are a few popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that could be suitable for your business as a disco owner in the nightlife industry. Some options to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These web builders offer a variety of customizable templates and features that can help you create a professional-looking website.

Static-site generators, such as Gatsby and Hugo, are also a good option for building a website for your business. These tools allow you to create a static website using simple code, and they are often faster and more secure than dynamic web builders.

There are also a number of popular open-source apps that can enhance the overall user experience of your website. Some examples include social media integration tools, e-commerce platforms, and event scheduling tools.

It's important to consider the pros and cons of each option when deciding which open-source technology to use for your website. Some potential pros of using open-source technology include cost-effectiveness, access to a large community of developers, and the ability to customize your website to meet your specific needs. Some potential cons include a lack of dedicated support and the potential for security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the cost of using open-source technology to build your website will depend on the specific tools and resources you choose to use. It's important to carefully research and compare the costs and benefits of different options before making a decision.

The word distiller is derived from the Latin word distillare, which means "to drip or trick down." The term originally referred to the process of distillation, which involves the separation of a mixture of liquids based on their boiling points. The word distillation has been used in various contexts throughout history, including in the production of essential oils, perfumes, and medicinal remedies.

The term distilled spirits, also known as liquor, refers to any alcoholic beverage that has been produced through the process of distillation. The origins of distilled spirits can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans, who used distillation to create a variety of aromatic and medicinal products. Over time, the production and consumption of distilled spirits became more widespread, and the term came to refer specifically to alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, rum, gin, and vodka.

The meaning of both distiller and distilled spirits has remained largely unchanged over time, with both terms still referring to the process of distillation and the resulting products. However, the production and consumption of distilled spirits has evolved significantly over the centuries, with the development of new techniques and the emergence of new styles and flavors.

As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons. First and foremost, it allows for greater customization and control over the design and functionality of your website. With open-source tools, you have the ability to tailor the website to your specific business needs and goals, rather than being limited by the limitations of a proprietary platform. Additionally, using open-source technology can often result in cost savings, as you do not have to pay for a proprietary platform or license fees.

Some of the leading open-source web builders that I recommend for building a website in the distilled spirits industry include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of templates and themes that can be easily customized to fit the needs of your business, and they offer a variety of plugins and extensions that can add additional functionality to your website.

Static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, are also great options for building a website for your business. These tools allow you to create a website that is fast, secure, and easy to maintain, as the content is generated statically rather than dynamically.

There are also a number of open-source apps that can be deployed on your own server to enhance the overall user experience of your website. Some popular options include Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress, eCommerce platforms like Magento and WooCommerce, and social media integrations like Twitter and Facebook.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your own website far outweigh the potential drawbacks. While there may be some initial costs associated with building and maintaining your own website, the long-term benefits of having full control over your website's design and functionality make it a worthwhile investment. So, it is always better to use open-source technology to build a website for your business.

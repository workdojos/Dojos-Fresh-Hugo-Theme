As a career counselor, I would first assess the individual's skills, interests and experience to determine if they are well suited for a career as a downtown business owner in the tourism industry. Some key skills that would be beneficial for this role include strong leadership and management abilities, excellent communication and customer service skills, and the ability to think strategically and make sound business decisions.

In terms of interests, it is important for the individual to have a passion for tourism and a desire to help people explore and experience new destinations. They should also be comfortable working long hours and handling a variety of tasks, as owning a business can be demanding and time-consuming.

Experience in the tourism industry or in a related field, such as hospitality or retail, would also be beneficial for this role. This could include working in a hotel or restaurant, managing a tourism-related business, or even traveling and exploring different destinations themselves.

To further explore this career path, I would recommend conducting research into the job market trends in the tourism industry, particularly in downtown areas. This could include exploring the demand for tourism services in different cities, the competition for business owners in this field, and the potential for growth and success.

In terms of qualifications, a bachelor's degree in business, tourism or a related field could be helpful for pursuing a career as a downtown business owner in the tourism industry. Additionally, obtaining certifications in areas such as customer service or marketing could also be beneficial for this role.

Overall, a career as a downtown business owner in the tourism industry could be a rewarding and fulfilling path for individuals with strong leadership and customer service skills, a passion for tourism, and experience in the industry. Conducting research into the job market and obtaining relevant qualifications can also help increase the individual's chances of success in this field.

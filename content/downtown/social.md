Sure, I'd be happy to help with your campaign! Here are a few ideas for how I could help:

Instagram: For Instagram, I would recommend creating visually appealing posts featuring your business, your products or services, and the local downtown area. You could also consider partnering with other local businesses or influencers to create a cohesive campaign and reach a wider audience.

Twitter: For Twitter, you could create short, punchy tweets promoting your business and encouraging people to come visit downtown. You could also use hashtags to connect with other businesses and tourists in the area.

Youtube: For YouTube, you could create a series of videos showcasing your business, the downtown area, and local attractions. This would be a great way to reach a wider audience and give people a taste of what your business has to offer.

Pinterest: For Pinterest, you could create boards featuring your business, the downtown area, and local attractions. You could also create boards featuring products or services you offer, as well as other things that may be of interest to tourists visiting the area.

Overall, it's important to be authentic and engaging in all of your social media posts and interactions. By connecting with your audience and providing valuable content, you'll be able to effectively promote your business and increase brand awareness.

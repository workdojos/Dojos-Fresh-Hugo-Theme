As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons. Firstly, open-source technology is typically free to use and customize, making it a cost-effective option for your business. Additionally, open-source technology is typically well-maintained and constantly updated by a community of developers, ensuring that your website stays up-to-date and secure.

Some of the leading open-source web builders that I recommend for building a website for your business in the tourism industry include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a variety of customizable templates and features that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of your business.

For a more lightweight and fast-loading website, you may also want to consider using a static-site generator such as Jekyll or Gatsby. These tools allow you to build a website using simple HTML and CSS, and can be easily deployed on your own server.

Other popular open-source apps that can enhance the overall user experience of your website include Google Maps for displaying location information, and social media integration tools such as ShareThis or AddThis for connecting with customers on social media platforms.

Overall, the pros of using open-source technology to build your website include cost-effectiveness, a constantly updated and secure platform, and the ability to customize and tailor the website to meet your specific business needs. The main con is that you may need to invest time and resources into learning how to use the technology, or hiring a developer to assist with the process. However, the long-term benefits of using open-source technology often outweigh the initial costs.

As a philosopher, I would begin by examining the ethical principles that govern the field of economics and the data science industry. This could include considerations such as the ethical implications of using data to make decisions, the potential for biased or unfair outcomes, and the responsibility to consider the consequences of one's actions on society.

Next, I would consider the specific goals and values of the economist in question, as well as any relevant stakeholders, such as clients, employees, and society at large. This could involve analyzing the ethical implications of different career paths or business practices, and determining which align most closely with the economist's personal values and the ethical standards of their field.

Finally, I would consider the role of external factors, such as laws, regulations, and societal expectations, in shaping the economist's ethical framework. This could involve researching existing ethical codes and guidelines within the data science industry, as well as engaging with relevant stakeholders to understand their expectations and concerns.

Ultimately, the goal of this process would be to develop a comprehensive ethical framework that guides the economist's decision-making and actions in their career, ensuring that they are acting in a way that is consistent with their values and the ethical standards of their field.

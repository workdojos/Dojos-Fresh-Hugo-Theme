The word "economist" comes from the Greek word "oikonomos," which means "manager of a household." The concept of economics as a field of study developed during the 18th century, and the term "economist" was first used to describe individuals who studied and wrote about economic theories and practices.

Over time, the meaning of the word "economist" has expanded to include individuals who analyze and advise on economic issues, such as policymakers, financial analysts, and business leaders. Today, economists are often experts in various fields, including finance, marketing, and business management, and are sought after for their expertise in understanding and predicting economic trends and patterns.

The term "data science" is a relatively new one, having only been coined in the late 20th century. It refers to the field of study that involves analyzing and interpreting large amounts of data in order to extract valuable insights and inform decision-making processes. Data science combines elements of computer science, statistics, and domain-specific expertise in order to extract meaning from data sets.

The origins of data science can be traced back to the development of computer technologies and the increasing availability of large amounts of data. As data sets grew in size and complexity, it became necessary to develop specialized tools and techniques for analyzing and interpreting them. Today, data science is an interdisciplinary field that plays a critical role in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and technology.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend considering open-source technology as a solution for building your website for several reasons. First, open-source technology is typically free to use and modify, which can significantly reduce the cost of building and maintaining a website compared to proprietary solutions. Additionally, open-source technology is often supported by a large community of developers and users who contribute to its development and improvement, which means you have access to a wide range of resources and support for troubleshooting issues or adding new features.

Some popular open-source options for building a website include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which offer a wide range of customization options and plugins for adding various features to your website. There are also several static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, which allow you to build a website using simple text files and templates, and are particularly well-suited for data-driven websites.

Another option to consider is using an open-source content management system (CMS) such as WordPress or Joomla, which allows you to easily manage and update your website's content and features without requiring any coding knowledge.

Overall, open-source technology offers a cost-effective and flexible solution for building and maintaining a website, and can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of your business. However, it's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option and ensure that you have the necessary technical expertise or resources to properly maintain and update your website.

As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology is often free to use and allows you to have complete control over your website's design and functionality. You can customize your website to meet your specific business needs and goals, rather than being limited to the options offered by a proprietary platform.

Second, open-source technology is constantly being updated and improved by a community of developers, which means you can benefit from the latest features and security updates without having to pay for a subscription or license.

There are many popular open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other tools available to choose from, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of templates, plugins, and other resources to help you build a professional-quality website quickly and easily.

There are also a number of static-site generators, such as Gatsby and Hugo, which are designed for building fast, lightweight websites that are easy to maintain and update. These tools are particularly useful for smaller businesses and organizations that don't need a lot of dynamic functionality.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your own website include cost savings, flexibility, and access to a wide range of resources and support from the developer community. However, it is important to note that using open-source technology does require some technical skills and resources, such as hosting, domain registration, and maintenance. It is also important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each platform and tool before making a decision.

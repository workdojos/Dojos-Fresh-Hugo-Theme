As a philosopher, I would recommend considering the ethical framework of deontology, which focuses on the inherent moral value of actions and duties. In the context of starting a career as an event planner in the special events industry, some key duties to consider within this framework may include:

Fidelity: This involves being loyal and faithful to clients, ensuring that their needs and desires are met to the best of your ability.

Non-maleficence: This involves avoiding causing harm or injury to others, including clients, attendees, and vendors.

Autonomy: This involves respecting the autonomy and decision-making ability of clients, allowing them to make their own choices about the events they wish to hold.

Benevolence: This involves acting in the best interests of others, including clients, attendees, and vendors, and striving to create positive experiences for all involved.

Another ethical framework to consider may be consequentialism, which focuses on the consequences of actions and the overall well-being of all involved. In this context, you may consider the potential impact of your events on the environment, the local community, and the overall well-being of attendees.

Ultimately, it is important to carefully consider the ethical implications of your actions as an event planner and strive to act in a way that is both responsible and respectful of all involved.

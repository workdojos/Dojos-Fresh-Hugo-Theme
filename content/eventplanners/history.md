Event planner:

The word "event" comes from the Latin "eventus," meaning "something that happens." The word "planner" comes from the Latin "planum," meaning "to plan or plot."

The term "event planner" likely originated in the late 20th century, as the field of event planning and management emerged as a professional discipline. Before this time, individuals who organized events were likely referred to as organizers or coordinators.

The meaning of the term "event planner" has remained largely unchanged over time, referring to a professional who is responsible for the planning and execution of events, such as parties, conferences, and weddings.

Special events:

The word "special" comes from the Latin "specialis," meaning "particular or distinguished." The word "event" has already been discussed above.

The term "special event" likely originated in the late 20th century, as the concept of organizing and hosting events specifically for a particular purpose or occasion became more common.

The meaning of the term "special event" has remained largely unchanged over time, referring to an event that is planned and organized for a specific purpose or occasion, often with the intention of attracting a large number of attendees or garnering significant attention. Examples of special events include festivals, concerts, and charity fundraisers.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for a few reasons. First, open-source technology allows for a more flexible and customizable website, as you have access to the source code and can make changes as needed. This can be especially useful for an event planner who may need to make frequent updates to the website to reflect new events or changes in business offerings.

In terms of open-source web builders, some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and customization options, and are relatively easy to use even for those with little coding experience.

For static-site generators, some options to consider include Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby. These tools allow you to create a static website that can be easily deployed on your own server, and are often faster and more secure than dynamic websites.

Other popular open-source apps to consider for your event planning website include event calendar plugins, booking and reservation systems, and social media integration tools.

One potential downside to using open-source technology is that it may require more time and effort to set up and maintain the website, as you will need to handle updates and security patches yourself. However, this can also be seen as a benefit, as you have complete control over the website and can make updates and changes as needed.

Overall, the pros of using open-source technology to build your own website include flexibility, customization, and control, while the potential cons include the need for more time and effort to set up and maintain the website. In terms of costs, open-source technology is often free to use, but you may incur costs for hosting and other add-on services.

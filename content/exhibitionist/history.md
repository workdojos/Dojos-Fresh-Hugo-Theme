Exhibitionist:
The word exhibitionist comes from the Latin "exhibere," which means "to show" or "to exhibit." It was first used in the late 19th century to describe someone who openly displays their sexual organs in public, often as a form of exhibitionism.

Over time, the meaning of the word has broadened to include anyone who exhibits their personal or private matters in a public setting, whether intentionally or not. This can include showing off personal possessions or traits, or simply behaving in a way that is attention-seeking or self-centered.

Art:
The word art comes from the Latin "ars," which means "skill" or "craftsmanship." It was originally used to describe the skills and techniques involved in creating objects or works of art, such as painting or sculpture.

Over time, the meaning of the word has expanded to include any form of creative expression, including literature, music, and dance. The concept of art has also evolved to include the appreciation and analysis of these forms of expression, as well as the cultural and social contexts in which they are created and consumed.

Special events:
The phrase "special events" is a relatively modern term, but it is derived from the Latin "specialis," which means "particular" or "distinct." It was originally used to describe events or occurrences that were considered unusual or exceptional in some way.

Over time, the meaning of the phrase has broadened to include any event that is planned and organized for a specific purpose or occasion, such as weddings, concerts, festivals, and corporate events. These events are often characterized by their unique themes, venues, and activities, and are often intended to be memorable or noteworthy in some way.

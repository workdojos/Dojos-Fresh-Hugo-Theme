As a career counselor, I would first assess the individual's skills, interests, and experience to determine if they are well-suited for a career in international business. Some key skills and qualities that are often required for success in this field include strong communication skills, the ability to work effectively in diverse teams, and a strong understanding of global business practices and cultural differences.

Additionally, I would recommend conducting research into the job market trends in the international business industry to get a sense of which areas are in high demand and what qualifications and experience are necessary to be competitive in these fields. Some potential career paths in international business include roles in international trade, foreign investment, international marketing, and global supply chain management.

In terms of qualifications, earning a bachelor's degree in a relevant field such as international business, finance, or marketing is often a good starting point for those interested in pursuing a career in international business. In addition, obtaining a Master's in Business Administration (MBA) with a focus on international business can also be beneficial, as it can provide in-depth knowledge of global business practices and give individuals a competitive edge in the job market.

Overall, a career in international business can be rewarding and challenging for those who are well-suited to this field. By assessing their skills, interests, and experience, conducting research into the job market trends and industry, and obtaining relevant qualifications, individuals can set themselves up for success in this exciting and dynamic industry.

As a philosopher, I would approach this task by first examining the various ethical theories that exist in the field of philosophy. This could include deontological theories, which focus on the moral duties and obligations that individuals have, or consequentialist theories, which focus on the outcomes of actions.

Next, I would consider the specific challenges and ethical dilemmas that may arise when starting a career as an expat working in the international business industry. This could include issues related to cultural differences, power imbalances, and the potential for exploitation or abuse of resources.

Based on this analysis, I would then develop an ethical framework that takes into account these challenges and provides guidance on how to make ethical decisions in the face of these complex issues. This framework could include principles such as respect for cultural differences, fairness and justice, and a commitment to sustainability and responsible resource management.

Finally, I would consider how this ethical framework could be implemented in practice, including through the development of policies and practices that promote ethical conduct, as well as through the education and training of employees on ethical decision-making. Overall, my goal would be to create a comprehensive and practical ethical framework that can guide individuals in their careers as expats working in the international business industry.q

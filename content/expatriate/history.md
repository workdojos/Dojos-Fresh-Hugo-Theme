Expat: The word "expat" is derived from the word "expatriate," which comes from the Latin root "ex-" meaning "out of" and "patria" meaning "native country." The term was originally used to refer to individuals who were living abroad but were still citizens of their home country. Over time, the meaning of the word has broadened to include anyone living and working in a foreign country, regardless of their citizenship status.

International business: The term "international business" is derived from the Latin roots "inter-" meaning "between" and "nationalis" meaning "of a nation." The term refers to business activities that involve trade and investment across national borders. The concept of international business has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations that traded goods and services with other cultures. In modern times, the meaning of the term has expanded to include a wide range of activities, including the exchange of goods and services, the movement of capital and labor, and the formation of strategic alliances and partnerships between companies and countries.

As a web design consultant, I would suggest that using open-source technology to build your own website can be a cost-effective and efficient solution for your business. Open-source technologies are free to use and often come with a large community of developers and users who contribute to their development and maintenance. This means that you can access a wide range of resources and support when building and maintaining your website.

One of the benefits of using open-source technology is that it allows you to have full control over your website and its functionality. You can customize and add features as needed, without being restricted by proprietary software or licenses. This can be especially useful for businesses in the international business industry, as you may need to cater to a diverse set of users and clients.

Some popular open-source web builders and static-site generators include WordPress, Joomla, and Gatsby. These tools allow you to create professional-looking websites with minimal coding experience, and they offer a wide range of templates and themes to choose from.

There are also a number of popular open-source apps that can enhance the overall user experience of your website, such as chatbots, analytics tools, and e-commerce platforms. These can be easily integrated into your website, providing valuable functionality and insights to your business.

As with any technology, there are also potential drawbacks to using open-source solutions. One potential issue is that open-source technologies may not be as well-supported as proprietary software, and you may need to rely on the community for support and updates. Additionally, you may need to invest in hosting and maintenance costs in order to keep your website running smoothly.

Overall, I would recommend considering open-source technology as a cost-effective and customizable solution for your business's website. Careful research and consideration of the pros and cons of each option can help you make an informed decision about which tools and platforms are the best fit for your needs.

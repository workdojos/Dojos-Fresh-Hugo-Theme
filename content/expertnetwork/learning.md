Roles and responsibilities in consulting may include conducting research and analysis, developing and presenting recommendations to clients, and managing projects and teams.

Some questions a candidate may be asked in a consulting interview include:

Describe a time when you had to solve a complex problem. How did you approach it and what was the outcome?
How do you stay current on industry trends and developments?
How do you think about strategy? Give an example of how you have applied it in a previous experience.
How do you handle ambiguity or lack of clear direction in a project?
How do you build and maintain relationships with clients?

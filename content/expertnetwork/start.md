Great, let's get started! First of all, it's important to recognize that a career in consulting can be extremely rewarding and lucrative. As a consultant, you'll have the opportunity to work with a variety of clients on a wide range of projects, which means you'll always be learning and growing as a professional. Additionally, consultants are often paid very well, especially if you have specialized expertise or a strong track record of success.

One of the best things about a career in consulting is the flexibility it offers. Many consultants work on a project-by-project basis, which means you can choose the projects that interest you most and work on them at your own pace. This can be especially appealing if you're someone who values work-life balance and doesn't want to be tied down to a traditional 9-5 job.

Another perk of working as a consultant is the opportunity to travel. Many consulting projects require travel to different locations, which can be a great way to see the world and experience different cultures. This is especially true if you work for a large consulting firm that has global reach.

In terms of little-known facts, one thing to keep in mind is that consulting can be a very competitive industry. It's important to be proactive in building your network and staying up-to-date on the latest trends and best practices. However, if you put in the work and establish yourself as an expert in your field, the rewards can be significant.

As far as useful websites go, there are a few that can be particularly helpful for those interested in a career in consulting. One is Consulting.com, which is a great resource for learning about the consulting industry and staying up-to-date on the latest trends and best practices. Another is the website for the Management Consulting Association, which offers a wealth of information on consulting careers and opportunities.

Finally, it's important to remember that a career in consulting can be incredibly exciting and rewarding. The industry is constantly evolving and there are always new challenges and opportunities to tackle. With the right attitude and approach, you can achieve great success as a consultant and make a real impact on the world.

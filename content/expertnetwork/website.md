As a web design consultant, I would suggest that using open-source technology to build your own website has a number of benefits for your business as a consulting firm.

One of the main benefits of open-source technology is that it is generally free to use. This means that you can save money on the initial development costs of your website, as you won't need to purchase proprietary software or licenses. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses or startups with limited budgets.

Another benefit of open-source technology is that it is often more customizable and flexible than proprietary software. This means that you can tailor the website to your specific needs and business goals, and make changes or updates as needed.

In terms of specific open-source web builders and static-site generators, some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a range of features and tools for building and managing a website, and have a large user base and community support.

There are also a number of other open-source apps that can be useful for consulting firms, such as project management tools like Asana or Trello, and customer relationship management software like SugarCRM.

One potential downside of using open-source technology is that it may require a bit more technical expertise to set up and maintain, as you will need to handle your own hosting and server management. However, this can also be a benefit if you have a team with these skills, as you will have more control over your website and can make changes and updates as needed.

Overall, the decision to use open-source technology for your website will depend on your specific business needs and goals, as well as your budget and technical expertise. It can be a cost-effective and flexible option, but it's important to weigh the pros and cons and assess whether it is the right fit for your business.

As a philosopher, I would first consider the ethical theories of deontology and consequentialism. Deontology asserts that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. In this case, an ethical framework for starting a career as an outdoor explorer may include considering the moral duties and responsibilities that come with this role, such as ensuring the safety of clients and respecting the natural environment.

On the other hand, consequentialism holds that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences. In this framework, an outdoor explorer may consider the potential consequences of their actions on the environment and the well-being of those involved in the outdoor exploration industry. This may involve considering the impact of their work on climate change, the conservation of natural resources, and the well-being of local communities.

In addition to these ethical theories, it may be helpful to consider the values and principles of the outdoor exploration industry, such as sustainability and respect for the natural environment. It may also be useful to consider the ethical guidelines and codes of conduct for outdoor professionals, such as those set by organizations like the Association for Outdoor Recreation and Education.

Ultimately, the development of an ethical framework for starting a career as an outdoor explorer will involve a careful consideration of both the inherent moral duties and responsibilities of this role, as well as the potential consequences of one's actions on the environment and the well-being of others.

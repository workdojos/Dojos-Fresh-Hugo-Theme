The word "explorer" comes from the Latin word "explorare," which means "to search out or examine." This word was formed by combining the prefix "ex-" meaning "out" and "plorare," meaning "to search or explore." In its original Latin form, the word referred to the act of searching or examining something in order to learn more about it.

Over time, the word "explorer" has come to be associated with people who travel to new or unfamiliar places in order to discover and learn about them. This is likely because explorers often had to search and examine new areas in order to find out what was there. In modern English, an explorer is typically someone who travels to new or uncharted places in order to learn about them, or someone who is curious and adventurous in their pursuit of new knowledge.

The word "outdoor" is derived from the Old English word "ūtweard," which means "external" or "outward." This word was formed by combining the prefix "ūt-" meaning "out" and "weard," meaning "guard" or "ward." In its original form, the word referred to things that were outside or external to something else.

Over time, the word "outdoor" has come to be associated with activities or events that take place outside or in natural surroundings, rather than inside a building or other enclosed space. This is likely because many outdoor activities involve being outside and in nature, rather than being inside. In modern English, an outdoor activity is typically one that takes place outside or in a natural setting, such as hiking, camping, or playing sports.

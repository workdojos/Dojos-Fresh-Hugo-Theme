As a career counselor, I would first recommend that the individual take some time to consider their specific skills, interests, and experience in relation to the export industry. This could include researching the various types of export positions available and the responsibilities involved in each role.

In terms of skills, it would be beneficial for the individual to have strong communication and organizational skills, as well as an understanding of international business and trade. They may also need to be proficient in a foreign language, depending on the markets they will be working with.

It is also important for the individual to have an interest in the export industry and an understanding of current market trends. This could involve staying up to date with news and developments in the industry, as well as networking with professionals in the field.

Experience in the export industry could be helpful, but is not necessarily required. However, any related experience, such as in logistics, international sales, or customer service, could be beneficial.

In terms of qualifications, a bachelor's degree in international business or a related field could be beneficial for pursuing a career in exporting. In addition, obtaining a certification in export management, such as the Certified Export Specialist (CES) designation, could also be helpful.

In terms of job market trends, the export industry is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. However, competition for export positions may be higher in certain industries or regions. It is important for the individual to conduct their own research and consider the specific markets and companies they would like to work with in order to determine the best path forward.

Overall, pursuing a career in exporting requires strong communication and organizational skills, an interest in the export industry, and a willingness to stay up to date with market trends. Obtaining a bachelor's degree and/or certification in export management could also be beneficial. It is important for the individual to conduct their own research and consider their specific skills, interests, and experience in order to determine the best path forward.

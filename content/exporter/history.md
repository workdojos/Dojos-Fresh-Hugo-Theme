The word "exporter" comes from the Latin word "exportare," which means "to carry out." This word is formed by combining the prefix "ex-" (meaning "out") with the verb "portare" (meaning "to carry").

The word "export" also comes from the Latin word "exportare." It entered the English language in the late 14th century, and originally referred to the act of carrying goods or products out of a country for the purpose of trade.

Over time, the meaning of the word "export" has slightly evolved. Today, it can also refer to the act of sending or transferring something (such as data or information) out of a country or system.

In terms of the word "exporter," it was first used in the early 17th century to refer to someone who engages in the act of exporting goods or products. It is now often used to describe a company or individual that specializes in exporting goods or products to other countries.

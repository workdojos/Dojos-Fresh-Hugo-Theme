Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are some suggestions for an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest to promote your new business as an exporter:

On Instagram, create visually appealing posts showcasing your products or services and the benefits of working with your company. Use hashtags related to the export industry to reach a wider audience. Utilize Instagram Stories to show behind-the-scenes glimpses of your business and engage with followers through polls and Q&A's.

On Twitter, share relevant industry news and updates, as well as promotional posts about your business. Engage with other users by replying to tweets and participating in relevant Twitter chats.

On YouTube, create informative and educational videos about the export industry and how your business can help clients succeed in this field. Utilize YouTube's community feature to engage with viewers and encourage them to ask questions or share their own experiences.

On Pinterest, create boards featuring your products or services and other relevant content related to the export industry. Utilize Pinterest's promoted pins feature to increase the visibility of your content and drive traffic to your website.

I hope these suggestions are helpful in creating an engaging campaign to promote your business. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

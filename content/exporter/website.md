As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology is free to use and modify, which can save your organization significant costs compared to proprietary software. It also allows you to customize the website to meet your specific business needs and goals.

Second, open-source technology is constantly being updated and improved by a community of developers, ensuring that you have access to the latest features and security updates.

There are several popular open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other apps that can be used to create a professional and user-friendly website for your business. Some examples include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal for web builders, and Gatsby and Next.js for static-site generators.

However, it's important to note that using open-source technology may require a higher level of technical expertise and resources compared to using a proprietary platform. Additionally, there may be limitations in terms of available support and documentation compared to proprietary solutions.

Ultimately, the decision to use open-source technology for your website will depend on your organization's specific needs and resources. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option before making a decision.

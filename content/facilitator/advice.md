First of all, it's important to understand that project management is a highly sought-after skill in many industries, not just automation. Project managers are responsible for coordinating and organizing various aspects of a project, including resources, budgets, and timelines. They must also be able to effectively communicate and collaborate with team members, clients, and stakeholders.

Based on your desire to work in the automation industry, it's clear that you have an interest in technology and how it can be used to improve efficiency and productivity. This is a great foundation for a career in project management, as the automation industry is constantly evolving and requires individuals who are able to adapt and stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies.

To pursue a career as a project manager in the automation industry, it would be beneficial to have a bachelor's degree in a related field such as computer science, engineering, or business. Additionally, obtaining a project management certification, such as the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification, can give you a competitive edge in the job market.

As far as job market trends go, the automation industry is expected to continue growing and expanding in the coming years. This means that there will likely be plenty of opportunities for skilled project managers in this field. However, competition for these positions can be high, so it's important to have a strong resume and portfolio of past projects to showcase your skills and experience.

Overall, pursuing a career as a project manager in the automation industry can be a fulfilling and rewarding choice. With the right combination of education, experience, and certification, you can position yourself as a strong candidate in this growing field.

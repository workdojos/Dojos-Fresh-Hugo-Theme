Project managers:

The word "project" comes from the Latin word "projectum," which means "something thrown forward." The word "manager" comes from the Latin "manu agere," which means "to handle."

The concept of project management has been around for centuries. The first known use of the term "project manager" was in the early 20th century, when it was used to describe someone who oversaw construction projects. Over time, the role of the project manager has evolved to include overseeing all aspects of a project, including planning, execution, and monitoring.

Automation:

The word "automation" comes from the Greek "automatos," which means "self-acting." It was first used in the early 19th century to describe the use of mechanical devices to perform tasks without human intervention.

Over time, the meaning of the word "automation" has evolved to include the use of computer systems to perform tasks without human intervention. Today, automation is often used to refer to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to perform tasks and make decisions.

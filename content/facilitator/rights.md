As a project manager working in the automation industry, I have seen firsthand the impact that fair work practices can have on both the success of a project and the well-being of the workers. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards prioritizing profits over people, with some companies cutting corners and cutting wages in order to maximize their profits.

However, this approach is short-sighted and ultimately detrimental to both the workers and the company as a whole. Fair treatment and proper wages are crucial for attracting and retaining top talent, and workers who feel valued and respected are more likely to be motivated and productive.

One recent event that highlights the importance of fair work practices is the COVID-19 pandemic. Many companies in the automation industry have struggled to adapt to the new realities of remote work and social distancing, and some have taken advantage of this opportunity to cut costs by laying off workers or reducing wages.

However, this approach is not only unfair, it is also unsustainable. Workers who are treated poorly are more likely to leave the company or become disengaged, leading to decreased productivity and increased turnover. In the long run, investing in fair treatment and proper wages is not only the right thing to do, it is also good for business.

As a project manager, I believe it is my responsibility to advocate for fair work practices and to ensure that all workers are treated with respect and given the wages and benefits they deserve. By promoting workerâ€™s rights and fair treatment, we can create a more productive and successful industry for all.

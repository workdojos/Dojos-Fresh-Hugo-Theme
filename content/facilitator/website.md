As a web design consultant, I recommend considering open-source technology for building your website for several reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for greater customization and flexibility in terms of design and functionality. You can easily modify the code to meet your specific needs and preferences, rather than being limited to the templates and features provided by a proprietary platform. Additionally, open-source technology often has a strong community of developers and users who contribute to the project and offer support, which can be especially helpful if you encounter any issues during the development process.

Some popular open-source options for building a website include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which are all content management systems that allow for easy creation and management of a website. For a more lightweight and simple option, you may consider using a static-site generator such as Jekyll or Hugo, which generate a website from plain text files and do not require a database.

There are also a number of open-source apps and tools that can be used to enhance the functionality and user experience of your website, such as form builders, e-commerce platforms, and chatbot software.

In terms of costs, using open-source technology can be more cost-effective compared to proprietary solutions as it does not require any licensing fees. However, you may need to invest in hosting and maintenance costs, as well as the time and resources required for development and customization.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology for building a website include greater customization, flexibility, and support, as well as potential cost savings. It is important to carefully consider your specific needs and resources in order to determine the best solution for your business.

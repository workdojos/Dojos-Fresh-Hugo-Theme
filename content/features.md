Make the connections between the things that matter in your digital lives!  Odds are there's an API for just about everything you could want.  Finding them is one thing, but making them talk to any of the others will be a challenge.  That's where n8n comes in.

n8n allows you to "speak to" all the digital bits and bobs that are floating out within your digital sea.  Somebody you know having a birthday?  Queue up a birthday card to mailed out!  Want to know when Covid levels are increasing in your county via both e-mail and text message?  No problem.  With n8n, anything's possible.

Wouldn't it be great if Wordpress had functionality for memberships and payments built in.  Well, Ghost does.  Along with a very inviting UI, Ghost is a joy to work with.  Blogging needs consistency and nothing breeds consistency better than an amazing user experience.  Ghost brings it!

{{% title3 "Static websites." %}}

Nothing brings me down more than having to update Wordpress plugins on dozens of sites that nobody uses!  If you're not attracting sign-ups to your Wordpress, really what's the bother at all in having a dynamic website?

Static sites to the rescue.  Since Work Dojos moved to Hugo (a static site generator built with speed in mind), we honestly don't think we'll ever go back.  It takes a fundamental shift in understanding for how static sites work, but it's revolutionized how we work.  No kidding!

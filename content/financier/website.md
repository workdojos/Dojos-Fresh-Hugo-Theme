As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons.

Firstly, using open-source technology allows you to have complete control over the design and functionality of your website. With open-source software, you have access to the source code and can make any modifications or customizations that you see fit. This is particularly useful if you have specific business goals that you want to achieve with your website.

In addition, open-source technology is generally more affordable than proprietary options. While you may have to pay for hosting and support services, the initial cost of building a website with open-source technology is often significantly lower than using proprietary software.

There are also a number of popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that can be used to create a professional-looking website with minimal coding knowledge. Some of the leading options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a range of templates, plugins, and integrations that can help you build a website that meets your specific needs.

One potential downside to using open-source technology is that you may have to rely on a community of developers and users for support and updates. However, the large user base of many open-source platforms means that there is often a wealth of resources and documentation available to help you troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can be a cost-effective and customizable solution for your business. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option and weigh them against your specific business needs and goals.

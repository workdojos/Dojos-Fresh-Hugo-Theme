As a philosopher, I would recommend starting by examining the concept of "ethics." Ethics refers to a set of principles or values that guide our behavior and decision-making. In the context of a career as a firefighter, it might be helpful to consider the following ethical questions:

What are the core values that should guide the actions of a firefighter? For example, you might consider values such as bravery, compassion, integrity, and professionalism.

How can these values be applied in practical terms? For example, how might a firefighter demonstrate compassion while also maintaining professional boundaries?

What ethical dilemmas or challenges might a firefighter face in their work, and how can they be resolved in a way that is consistent with their values?

To develop a comprehensive ethical framework, you may also want to consider the broader social and political context in which firefighters operate. For example, you might consider questions such as:

How do issues of social justice, equity, and inclusion impact the work of firefighters?

How do the policies and practices of the public services industry align with or diverge from ethical values?

By examining these and other questions, you can begin to build a comprehensive ethical framework for your career as a firefighter.

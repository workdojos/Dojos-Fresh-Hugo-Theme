Sure! Here are some ideas for an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, and Pinterest to promote your new business as a firefighter working in the public services industry:

Instagram: Create a series of Instagram posts showcasing your work as a firefighter and the importance of public services in the community. Share behind-the-scenes photos and videos of you and your team on the job, and use relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience.

Twitter: Tweet about your experiences as a firefighter and share helpful safety tips and resources for the community. Engage with your followers by asking them to share their own stories and experiences with public services.

Youtube: Create a Youtube channel and upload videos of your work as a firefighter. You could also create educational videos about fire safety and the importance of public services in the community.

Pinterest: Create a Pinterest board featuring images and infographics about fire safety, public services, and your business. Pin your own content as well as relevant articles and resources from other sources to engage with your followers.

Additionally, franchise owners often face strict restrictions on their ability to operate and make decisions, leading to feelings of frustration and powerlessness.

Despite these challenges, the franchise industry is an important part of the economy, providing jobs and opportunities for millions of people around the world.

This can be achieved through a variety of measures, including offering more flexible and affordable franchise agreements, providing better support and resources for franchise owners, and increasing pay and benefits for those working in the industry.

Franchisors should be held to high standards of ethical conduct, and be required to provide full disclosure of all terms and conditions to potential franchisees. Additionally, there should be more resources available to help franchise owners navigate the complex world of franchising, including legal support, training and mentorship programs, and access to financing and capital.

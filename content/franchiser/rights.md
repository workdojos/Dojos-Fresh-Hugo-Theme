As a debater, it is my duty to present both sides of the argument in order to provide a well-rounded and informed perspective on the topic at hand. In this case, the topic is fair work practices for franchise business owners working in the franchising industry.

On one side, it can be argued that franchise business owners have the right to run their businesses as they see fit, including setting wages and determining work practices. After all, they are the ones taking the financial risk and investing their time and resources into the business. Additionally, many franchise business owners may argue that they have to adhere to strict guidelines and standards set by the franchisor, which may limit their ability to make changes to wages and work practices.

However, on the other side, it is important to consider the rights and well-being of the workers. Workers have the right to fair treatment and proper wages, and it is the responsibility of the business owner to ensure that these rights are respected. In recent years, there have been numerous instances of franchise business owners exploiting their workers and failing to provide fair wages, leading to widespread protests and calls for change.

Furthermore, the franchising industry has seen a trend towards increasingly low wages and poor working conditions. Many franchise business owners are under pressure to meet the demands of their franchisor, which can lead to cutting corners and exploiting their workers in order to maximize profits. This is not only unethical, but it can also lead to a negative reputation for the franchise, ultimately damaging the business in the long run.

In conclusion, while franchise business owners have the right to run their businesses as they see fit, it is important to prioritize the rights and well-being of the workers. Fair treatment, proper wages, and good working conditions are crucial for the success and sustainability of any business, and franchise business owners should be held accountable for upholding these standards.

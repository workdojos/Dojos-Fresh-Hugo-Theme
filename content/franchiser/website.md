As a web design consultant, I would recommend considering the use of open-source technology to build your website for a few reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for a high level of customization and flexibility. This means that you can tailor the website to meet the specific needs of your business, rather than being limited to the capabilities of a proprietary platform. Additionally, open-source technology often comes with a large community of developers who contribute to the project and offer support, which can be incredibly valuable when building and maintaining your website.

Another benefit of open-source technology is cost. Many open-source platforms and tools are free to use, which can save you significant costs compared to proprietary solutions. However, it's important to note that while the initial cost may be lower, you may incur additional costs for hosting, maintenance, and custom development.

For a franchise business, it's important to consider the scalability of your website. Open-source technology can offer the ability to easily replicate and scale your website as your franchise grows. This can be especially valuable if you plan on expanding your franchise to multiple locations.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that can be used to build a website, including WordPress, Joomla, and Hugo. It's important to research and compare the pros and cons of each platform to determine which one is the best fit for your business.

Ultimately, the decision to use open-source technology for your website will depend on your specific needs and goals. I recommend considering the level of customization and flexibility you need, the scalability of your website, and the costs involved in order to make the most informed decision.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization in the design and functionality of your website. This means you can tailor the website to meet the specific needs of your business as a geneticist in the biotechnology industry.

Additionally, using open-source technology can often be more cost-effective compared to proprietary software, as you do not need to pay for licenses or subscriptions. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses or startups that are working with a limited budget.

Some of the leading open-source web builders that may be suitable for your business include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and tools to help you create a professional and functional website.

Static-site generators, such as Gatsby and Jekyll, are also popular choices for building websites as they offer fast loading times and the ability to host the website on your own server.

Other open-source apps that may be useful for your business include Calendly for scheduling appointments and Zoom for virtual meetings.

Overall, using open-source technology can provide many benefits for your business, including flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and access to a wide range of features and tools. However, it is important to also consider the potential downsides, such as the need for technical knowledge and the potential for security vulnerabilities. It is also important to consider the costs associated with hosting and maintaining a website on your own server.

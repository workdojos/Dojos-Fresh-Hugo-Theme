First, let's start with Instagram. For an engaging campaign, I would suggest creating visually appealing posts showcasing your writing skills and the services you offer as a ghostwriter. You can also share behind-the-scenes content of your writing process and share your thoughts and insights on the writing and publishing industry. Utilize relevant hashtags such as #ghostwriter #writingcommunity #publishing to reach a wider audience.

Next, let's move on to Twitter. Here, you can tweet about your writing journey, share quotes and tips on writing, and engage with other writers and publishing professionals by retweeting and commenting on their tweets. Twitter is also a great platform to share news and updates about your business, as well as any upcoming events or promotions you have.

On YouTube, you can create videos sharing your writing tips and experiences as a ghostwriter, as well as vlogs showcasing your writing process. You can also do Q&A videos where you answer questions from your followers about the writing and publishing industry.

Finally, on Pinterest, you can create boards featuring writing prompts, tips, and resources for writers, as well as visual content showcasing your writing skills and the services you offer as a ghostwriter. Utilize relevant hashtags and descriptions to reach a wider audience.

Overall, the key to a successful social media campaign is to consistently create engaging and relevant content, interact with your followers, and utilize relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience.

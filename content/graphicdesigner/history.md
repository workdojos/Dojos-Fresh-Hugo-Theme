The word "graphic" comes from the Greek word "graphein," which means "to write or draw." The word "design" comes from the Latin word "designare," which means "to mark out." The word "arts" comes from the Latin word "ars," which means "skill or craft."

The concept of graphic design can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where art was often used for communication and documentation purposes. In ancient Egypt, for example, hieroglyphics were used to record information and convey messages. In ancient Greece, graphic design was used for signage, coin design, and architectural decoration.

The term "graphic designer" was first coined in 1922 by William Addison Dwiggins, a typographer and book designer. Dwiggins believed that the term "commercial artist" was too limiting and proposed the term "graphic designer" to describe the broader field of design that included typography, illustration, and page layout.

Over time, the field of graphic design has evolved to include a variety of media, including print, digital, and interactive design. It is now a professional field that includes a wide range of disciplines, including branding, packaging design, web design, and user interface design. The term "graphic arts" is often used to refer to the broader field of visual communication and includes a variety of media, including printmaking, photography, and film.

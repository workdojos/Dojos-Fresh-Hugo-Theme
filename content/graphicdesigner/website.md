As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons. First and foremost, open-source technology is often free to use and can save you significant costs in the long run. Additionally, open-source technology is often more customizable and flexible, allowing you to easily make changes and updates to your website as needed.

One of the leading open-source web builders that I would recommend is WordPress. WordPress is a powerful content management system that is popular among both developers and non-developers. It offers a wide range of themes and plugins that can be used to easily create a professional-looking website without the need for coding knowledge.

Another option to consider is a static-site generator such as Jekyll or Gatsby. Static-site generators allow you to create a fast and lightweight website that is easy to maintain and update. They are especially useful for graphic designers as they allow you to easily showcase your portfolio and design work.

Other popular open-source apps that you might consider using include Drupal, Magento, and OpenCart. Each of these tools has its own set of pros and cons, so it is important to carefully consider which one will best meet your business needs.

Overall, using open-source technology can be a great way to save costs and create a professional website that meets your business goals. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option and to do your research before making a decision.

To determine if a career as a grower in the cannabis industry is a good fit for you, it's important to consider your skills, interests, and experience. Do you have a strong background in agriculture or horticulture? Do you have experience working with plants or are you interested in learning more about plant biology?

In terms of qualifications, it's helpful to have a degree in a related field such as agriculture, horticulture, or biology. Additionally, obtaining a cannabis cultivation certification or attending workshops or training programs can also be beneficial in increasing your knowledge and skills in the field.

Overall, if you have a strong interest in plant biology and agriculture, have a good attention to detail, and are comfortable working in a regulated industry, a career as a grower in the cannabis industry may be a good fit for you. It's important to conduct thorough research and continue to educate yourself on the industry to ensure success in this field. Good luck on your career journey!

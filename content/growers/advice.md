Additionally, obtaining a cannabis cultivation certification or attending workshops or training programs can also be beneficial in increasing your knowledge and skills in the field.

Overall, if you have a strong interest in plant biology and agriculture, have a good attention to detail, and are comfortable working in a regulated industry, a career as a grower in the cannabis industry may be a good fit for you. It's important to conduct thorough research and continue to educate yourself on the industry to ensure success in this field. Good luck on your career journey!

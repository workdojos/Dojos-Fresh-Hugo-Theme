As a philosopher, one of the first things that comes to mind when considering an ethical framework for starting a career in the cannabis industry is the issue of legality. It is important to consider whether or not cannabis is legal in the jurisdiction in which you will be operating, as this can have significant implications for your ethical obligations.

One possibility for developing an ethical framework in this context is to consider the principles of social justice and fairness. In particular, it might be worth considering whether or not the cannabis industry is contributing to the overall well-being and prosperity of society, or whether it is exacerbating existing inequalities or contributing to harm.

Another important ethical consideration might be the potential impacts on individual health. This could include both the potential risks and benefits of consuming cannabis, as well as the potential risks and benefits of working in the industry itself.

Overall, it is clear that starting a career in the cannabis industry involves a number of complex ethical considerations, and it will be important to carefully consider these issues in order to develop a strong and coherent ethical framework. So, it is always better to do some research and analysis before starting any career.

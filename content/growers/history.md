The word "grower" is a relatively simple one, and its origins can be traced back to the Old English word "growan," which means "to grow." This word is derived from the Proto-Germanic word "grōan," which also means "to grow." The word has remained relatively unchanged in meaning since its ancient roots, and is still used today to refer to someone or something that causes something else to grow or increase in size.

The word "cannabis," on the other hand, has a somewhat more complex etymology. It is thought to be derived from the ancient Greek word "kánnabis," which is itself derived from the Scythian word "kánnabos." The Scythians were a group of ancient nomadic peoples who lived in what is now modern-day Russia and the surrounding areas. The word "kánnabos" is thought to refer to the hemp plant, which was used for a variety of purposes by the Scythians, including making clothing and ropes.

The meaning of the word "cannabis" has changed somewhat over time. In ancient times, it was primarily used to refer to the hemp plant, but today it is most commonly used to refer to the psychoactive drug that is derived from the plant. This change in meaning is thought to have occurred in the early 20th century, as the use of cannabis as a recreational drug became more widespread. Despite this change in meaning, the word is still sometimes used to refer to the hemp plant itself, particularly in the context of agriculture and the production of hemp-based products.

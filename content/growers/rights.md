The cannabis industry is rapidly growing and with it comes a need for fair work practices for growers. There have been several recent trends and events in the industry that highlight the importance of promoting worker's rights, fair treatment, and proper wages for these workers.

One trend that has emerged in the cannabis industry is the exploitation of workers. In some cases, growers are paid low wages and are expected to work long hours in difficult conditions. This is unacceptable and goes against the principles of fair work practices. Workers deserve to be treated with respect and to be compensated fairly for their efforts.

Another trend that has emerged in the cannabis industry is the lack of protections for workers. Many growers are not covered by traditional labor laws, which leaves them vulnerable to mistreatment and exploitation. This is a major concern and needs to be addressed in order to ensure that workers are treated fairly.

One recent event that highlights the need for fair work practices in the cannabis industry is the COVID-19 pandemic. Many growers have been working tirelessly to keep up with demand, but have not received proper protective equipment or hazard pay. This is unacceptable and shows the need for better protections for these essential workers.

In conclusion, it is essential that we promote fair work practices for growers in the cannabis industry. This includes ensuring that workers are treated with respect, compensated fairly, and protected from exploitation and mistreatment. By supporting these principles, we can create a more just and equitable industry for all.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization in the design and development process. This means that you can tailor the website to fit your specific needs and preferences, rather than being limited to pre-designed templates or features.

In addition, open-source technology is generally more affordable than proprietary software, as it does not require any licensing fees. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses or startups, such as yours in the cannabis industry, that may be operating on a tight budget.

There are several leading open-source web builders and static-site generators that can be used to create a professional and user-friendly website. Some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which offer a wide range of customizable templates and features. Other popular open-source apps that can enhance the overall user experience include e-commerce platforms like Magento and WooCommerce, and content management systems like Ghost and Gatsby.

While there are many benefits to using open-source technology, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks as well. One potential downside is that open-source platforms may require more technical expertise to set up and maintain, as you will be responsible for managing updates and security measures on your own. Additionally, open-source technology may not offer the same level of support and resources as proprietary software, so it is important to research and carefully consider your options before making a decision.

Overall, I believe that using open-source technology to build your website can provide a great user experience and meet your business goals, while also offering cost-effective and customizable solutions. It is important to weigh the pros and cons and consider your specific needs and resources before making a decision.2

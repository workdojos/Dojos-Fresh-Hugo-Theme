As a philosopher, one approach to developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a guesthouse owner in the Hotel & Hospitality industry could be to consider the concept of moral responsibility. This involves considering the obligations and duties that come with being a guesthouse owner, and how these can be fulfilled in a way that is both fair and just.

One important aspect of moral responsibility in this context could be ensuring that guests are treated with respect and dignity, and that their privacy is protected. This could involve implementing policies and procedures to ensure that guests' personal information is secure, and that they are not subjected to any form of discrimination or harassment while staying at the guesthouse.

Another key aspect of moral responsibility could be ensuring that the guesthouse is operated in an environmentally sustainable manner. This could involve implementing measures to reduce energy and water usage, and sourcing products and services from suppliers who prioritize sustainability.

Finally, it may be important to consider the impact of the guesthouse on the local community, and to strive to be a positive contributor to the area. This could involve supporting local businesses, engaging in charitable work, and ensuring that the guesthouse is a good neighbor to those living in the surrounding area.

Overall, a strong ethical framework for starting a career as a guesthouse owner in the Hotel & Hospitality industry could involve prioritizing the well-being and rights of guests, protecting the environment, and contributing to the local community in a positive way.

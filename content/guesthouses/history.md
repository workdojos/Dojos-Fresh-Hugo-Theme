The word "guesthouse" can be traced back to the Old English word "gesthÅ«s," which means "guest house." This word was used to refer to a house or building where guests were welcomed and accommodated. The word "guest" itself comes from the Old English word "gest," which means "stranger" or "foreigner."

The word "bed and breakfast" is a combination of two words, "bed" and "breakfast." The word "bed" can be traced back to the Old English word "bedd," which means a place where one sleeps. The word "breakfast" can be traced back to the Middle English word "brekfast," which means the first meal of the day. The phrase "bed and breakfast" first appeared in the 19th century and refers to a type of accommodation where guests are provided with a bed and breakfast meal.

The word "hostel" can be traced back to the Old French word "hostel," which means a place where travelers could find lodging. The word "hostel" was later adopted into Middle English and is now used to refer to a type of budget accommodation, often offering shared dormitory-style rooms. The word "accommodation" can be traced back to the Latin word "accommodatus," which means "to make fit or suitable." The word "accommodation" is now used to refer to a place where travelers can find lodging or a place to stay.

Overall, the meanings of these words have remained relatively unchanged over time, with "guesthouse" referring to a place where guests are welcomed and accommodated, "bed and breakfast" referring to a type of accommodation where guests are provided with a bed and breakfast meal, and "hostel" referring to a budget accommodation often offering shared dormitory-style rooms.

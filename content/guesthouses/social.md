Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign to promote your new guesthouse business:

Instagram: Share visually appealing photos of your guesthouse, including the rooms, common areas, and outdoor spaces. Use relevant hashtags, such as #guesthouse #bedandbreakfast #hostel #travel to attract potential guests. Engage with your followers by asking them to share their own travel photos and experiences, and offer special discounts or promotions to those who share and tag your guesthouse.

Twitter: Share updates about your guesthouse, including new amenities, events, or special promotions. Use Twitter chats to connect with other guesthouse owners and travel industry professionals, and retweet relevant content that your followers may be interested in.

YouTube: Create a video tour of your guesthouse, showcasing the rooms, common areas, and outdoor spaces. Share tips and recommendations for things to do and see in the local area. Use YouTube's tagging and description features to make your videos more discoverable by potential guests.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring your guesthouse, as well as travel inspiration and ideas for things to do in the local area. Use Pinterest's rich pins feature to add extra information about your guesthouse, such as location, price, and availability. Engage with your followers by commenting on and repinning their content, and offer special discounts or promotions to those who repin your pins.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons. Firstly, open-source technology is often free to use, which can help save on costs compared to proprietary software. Additionally, open-source technology is usually highly customizable and flexible, allowing you to tailor the website to your specific business needs and goals.

Some popular open-source web builders that you may want to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and functionalities, making them suitable for a variety of businesses, including those in the Hotel & Hospitality industry.

Static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, are another option to consider. These tools allow you to create a website using simple files, rather than a complex database. This can be beneficial for smaller businesses that don't need a lot of dynamic content, as it can make the website easier to maintain and update.

There are also a number of popular open-source apps that can enhance the overall user experience of your website, such as chatbots and booking systems. These tools can help streamline communication and booking processes for your guests, making it easier for them to interact with your business.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can offer a number of benefits, including cost savings, flexibility, and a wide range of features and functionalities. However, it's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option before making a decision, as well as the costs involved. A web design consultant can help guide you through this process and recommend the most suitable solution for your business.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons. One major benefit of open-source technology is that it is typically free to use and customize, which can save your business a significant amount of money compared to proprietary software. Additionally, open-source technology often has a large and active community of developers and users, which means that there is a wealth of resources and support available to help you build and maintain your website.

There are a number of open-source web builders and static-site generators that can be used to create a professional and functional website for your business, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and customization options, making it easy to create a website that meets your specific needs and goals.

In terms of the pros and cons of using open-source technology, one major pro is that it is often more flexible and customizable than proprietary software. This means that you can easily modify and adapt your website as your business grows and changes over time. However, one potential con is that open-source technology may not be as user-friendly as proprietary software, which could be a challenge for those with limited coding experience.

In terms of costs, open-source technology is typically free to use, although you may need to pay for hosting and other related services. In comparison, proprietary software often requires a significant upfront investment, as well as ongoing subscription fees.

Overall, I would recommend considering open-source technology as a viable option for building your website, as it can provide a cost-effective and customizable solution that meets your business needs.

As a philosopher, one approach to developing an ethical framework for starting a career as an importer working in the supply-chain industry would be to consider the various moral theories that have been proposed by philosophers throughout history. These theories provide a framework for understanding how to make ethical decisions, and can be applied to a wide range of ethical dilemmas.

One approach to developing an ethical framework for this specific context might be to consider the concept of deontology, which is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of upholding certain moral duties and obligations. In the context of the supply-chain industry, this might involve considering the ethical implications of the products that are being imported, and ensuring that they are not being produced in a way that is harmful to people or the environment.

Another approach might be to consider the concept of utilitarianism, which is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of maximizing overall happiness or well-being. In this context, this might involve considering the impact of the products being imported on the lives of the people who are producing them, as well as the end consumers.

Ultimately, the specific ethical framework that is chosen will depend on the values and priorities of the individual importer, as well as the broader social and cultural context in which they are operating. By considering the various moral theories that have been proposed by philosophers, and reflecting on the specific context and challenges of the supply-chain industry, it should be possible to develop a robust and ethical framework for starting a career as an importer.

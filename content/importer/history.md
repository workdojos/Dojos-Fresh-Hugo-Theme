The word "importer" comes from the Latin "importare," which means "to carry in." The word "supply-chain" is a combination of the words "supply" and "chain." The word "supply" comes from the Old French "supplier," which means "to provide." The word "chain" comes from the Latin "catena," which means "chain."

The original meaning of "importer" referred to someone who brings goods into a country from another country. The meaning of the word has not changed significantly over time. The concept of a "supply-chain" refers to the network of businesses, organizations, and individuals involved in the production, handling, and distribution of a product or service. The concept of a supply-chain has evolved significantly over time as transportation and communication technologies have improved, allowing for more efficient and effective distribution of goods and services.

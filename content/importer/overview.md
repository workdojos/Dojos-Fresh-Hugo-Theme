One way to find opportunities to work in the supply chain industry is to network with those who are already working in the field. This can be done through industry events and conferences, joining professional associations, or even reaching out to professionals on social media or LinkedIn. Additionally, many companies offer internships and entry-level positions that can provide valuable experience and open the door to future opportunities.

As with any industry, there are both good and bad jobs to be had in the supply chain field. Some of the best jobs might include positions in management or leadership roles, which can offer lucrative salaries and opportunities for advancement.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization, as you have access to the source code and can make changes to the website as you see fit. This can be especially beneficial for a business in the supply-chain industry, as you may have specific needs or requirements for your website that may not be met by a pre-built platform.

In terms of popular open-source web builders, some options to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms are widely used and offer a wide range of features and customization options. Additionally, there are many static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Gatsby, which can be used to create a more lightweight and faster-loading website.

Another benefit of using open-source technology is the cost. While there may be some upfront costs associated with building your own website, such as purchasing a domain and hosting, these costs are typically much lower compared to using a proprietary platform or hiring a web design agency. Additionally, the use of open-source technology allows you to access a wide range of free resources and tools, such as themes, plugins, and extensions, which can further reduce costs.

However, there are also some potential downsides to using open-source technology. One potential issue is the lack of support compared to proprietary platforms. While there are often communities and forums available for support, these may not be as comprehensive as the support offered by a commercial platform. Additionally, building your own website may require a higher level of technical expertise, and may not be suitable for those without a strong background in web development.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your own website far outweigh the potential drawbacks. By choosing an open-source platform or static-site generator, you can create a customized website that meets the specific needs of your business, while also saving on costs and taking control of your website's development.

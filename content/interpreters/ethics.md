As a philosopher, I would approach this task by considering the various ethical theories that have been proposed throughout the history of philosophy. Some of the main ethical theories that could be relevant in this context include deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics.

Deontology is an ethical theory that focuses on the idea that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. In this theory, the right thing to do is determined by moral rules or duties that are considered to be universal and absolute.

Consequentialism, on the other hand, is an ethical theory that emphasizes the importance of considering the consequences of an action in determining its moral value. According to this theory, the right thing to do is the action that leads to the best overall consequences for the greatest number of people.

Virtue ethics is an ethical theory that focuses on the character traits and virtues of an individual, rather than specific actions or consequences. According to this theory, the right thing to do is the action that is in line with the virtues of a good person, such as honesty, compassion, and fairness.

In developing an ethical framework for starting a career as an interpreter, it would be important to consider all of these ethical theories and to consider how they might apply to the specific context of the translation and interpretation industry. For example, one might consider the deontological duty to accurately and faithfully translate and interpret the words of others, or the consequentialist consideration of the impact that one's translations and interpretations might have on others. Additionally, one might consider the virtues of honesty, fairness, and professionalism in deciding how to approach one's work as an interpreter.

Ultimately, the development of an ethical framework for starting a career as an interpreter will depend on the specific values and priorities of the individual in question. By considering the various ethical theories and how they might apply to this context, however, one can begin to develop a comprehensive and coherent ethical framework that will guide one's actions as an interpreter.

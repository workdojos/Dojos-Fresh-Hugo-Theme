The word "interpreter" comes from the Latin word "interpres," which means "explainer" or "mediator." It was originally used to describe someone who acted as a go-between, translating messages between people who spoke different languages.

The word "translation" comes from the Latin word "translatio," which means "a carrying across." It was originally used to describe the act of carrying something or someone from one place to another. In the context of language, it refers to the act of transferring the meaning of a text from one language to another.

The word "interpretation" comes from the Latin word "interpretatio," which means "explanation" or "exposition." It was originally used to describe the act of explaining or interpreting something, such as a text or a dream. In the context of language, it refers to the act of understanding and explaining the meaning of a text or speech in another language.

Over time, the meanings of these words have remained largely unchanged. However, they have also been expanded to include other forms of communication beyond language, such as sign language or nonverbal cues.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website. Because the source code is freely available, you can make changes and modifications to the website as needed to fit your specific business needs.

Second, open-source technology is generally more cost-effective than proprietary software. While there may be some initial costs associated with setting up and configuring the website, you will not have to pay ongoing licensing fees as you would with proprietary software. This can save your business a significant amount of money in the long run.

Third, open-source technology is often more secure than proprietary software. Because the source code is freely available, it is more likely to be thoroughly tested and reviewed by a community of developers, which can help identify and fix security vulnerabilities.

As for specific open-source web builders and static-site generators, there are several options available. Some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal for web builders, and Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby for static-site generators. Each of these options has its own pros and cons, and it is important to do some research to determine which one is the best fit for your business.

In terms of the costs associated with using open-source technology, there are generally two types of costs to consider: upfront costs and ongoing costs. Upfront costs may include the initial setup and configuration of the website, as well as any custom development or design work that may be needed. Ongoing costs may include hosting fees, maintenance, and any additional services or plugins that are needed to support the website. It is important to carefully consider these costs and weigh them against the benefits of using open-source technology in order to determine if it is a viable option for your business.

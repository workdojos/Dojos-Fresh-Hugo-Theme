As a career counselor, I would advise the individual interested in pursuing a career as an investigator in the investigation and security services industry to consider their skills, interests, and experience when deciding on a career path.

First, it is important to consider the individual's skills and what they are naturally talented at. Investigating and security work often requires strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the ability to work independently. If the individual has these skills, they may be well-suited for a career in this field.

Next, it is important to consider the individual's interests. Do they enjoy solving mysteries and uncovering the truth? Do they enjoy working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment? If the individual enjoys these types of activities, they may be more likely to find satisfaction and success in a career as an investigator.

It is also important to consider the individual's experience. Do they have any relevant experience, such as work in law enforcement or security? If so, this can be a valuable asset in pursuing a career as an investigator.

In terms of job market trends, the investigation and security services industry is expected to grow over the next decade. There is a high demand for skilled investigators, particularly in the private sector.

To pursue a career as an investigator, it may be beneficial for the individual to consider obtaining a degree in a relevant field, such as criminal justice or forensic science. They may also want to consider obtaining certification, such as a private investigator license, which may be required to work in certain states.

Overall, a career as an investigator in the investigation and security services industry can be fulfilling and rewarding for individuals with the right skills, interests, and experience. It is important for the individual to do their research and consider the necessary qualifications and training to succeed in this field.

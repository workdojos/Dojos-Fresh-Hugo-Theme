Investigator:
The word "investigator" comes from the Latin "investigare," which means "to follow up, track down, or search out." It was first used in English in the early 17th century to refer to someone who gathers information or evidence. Over time, the meaning of the word has expanded to include anyone who investigates or examines something in detail, such as a detective or researcher.

Investigation:
The word "investigation" comes from the Latin "investigatio," which means "examination, investigation, or inquiry." It was first used in English in the early 17th century to refer to the act of examining or inquiring into something. Over time, the meaning of the word has remained largely unchanged, although it has also come to refer specifically to the process of gathering and analyzing evidence in order to solve a crime or solve a problem.

Security Services:
The term "security services" is a relatively recent one, and it refers to a range of services and activities designed to protect people, property, and information from harm or unauthorized access. The word "security" comes from the Latin "securus," which means "safe, secure, or free from care." It was first used in English in the late 14th century to refer to the state of being safe or protected. The meaning of the word has remained largely unchanged, although it has also come to encompass a range of activities related to protecting people and property from harm.

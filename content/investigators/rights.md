As a debater, it is my duty to present both sides of the debate on fair work practices for investigators in the investigation and security services industry. However, in this particular case, I will be taking the side of the workers and promoting worker's rights, fair treatment, and proper wages.

One recent trend in the industry has been the increasing reliance on contractors and temporary workers, rather than hiring permanent employees. This can lead to a lack of job security and benefits for these workers, as they are often not entitled to the same protections as permanent employees. This can result in lower wages, fewer opportunities for advancement, and a lack of access to important resources such as training and professional development.

On the other hand, some may argue that hiring contractors and temporary workers allows for flexibility and cost savings for companies. However, this often comes at the expense of the workers, who may be working long hours for low pay and without the security of a permanent job.

Another issue in the industry is the lack of proper training and support for investigators. Without proper training, workers may be put in dangerous situations without the necessary skills to handle them. This can lead to injury or even death, as we have seen in recent years with the rise of security guard deaths in the United States.

In contrast, some may argue that proper training and support is costly and can lead to higher expenses for companies. However, investing in the safety and well-being of workers is not only the ethical thing to do, but it can also lead to increased productivity and morale among employees.

In conclusion, it is important for the investigation and security services industry to prioritize fair work practices for its employees. This includes ensuring job security, fair wages, and proper training and support. While cost savings may be a concern for companies, investing in the well-being of workers is not only the right thing to do, but it can also lead to increased productivity and success in the long run.

First off, congratulations on considering a career as a investigator in the investigation and security services industry! This is a truly exciting and growing field with lots of upside potential.

One of the biggest perks of working as a investigator is the opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives. Whether you are working on cases related to corporate fraud, criminal investigations, or personal security, you will have the chance to help protect people and organizations from harm.

Another major benefit of this career is the potential for advancement and growth. As you gain experience and build your skills, you may have the opportunity to move up within your organization or even start your own investigation and security services firm.

In terms of little-known facts, did you know that the investigation and security services industry is expected to see significant job growth in the coming years? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in this field is projected to grow 6% between 2019 and 2029, which is faster than the average for all occupations. This means that now is a great time to start building your career in this exciting industry.

As for useful websites, I recommend checking out the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) and the International Association of Professional Security Consultants (IAPSC). Both organizations offer valuable resources and training opportunities for professionals in the investigation and security services industry.

Finally, it's important to approach your new career with a positive attitude and a sense of excitement. Working as a investigator can be challenging at times, but the rewards of helping others and making a positive impact in your community will make it all worth it. So embrace the challenge and go out there and make a difference!

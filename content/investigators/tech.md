As someone who has worked in the investigation and security services industry for several years, I can confidently say that the use of open-source technology is essential to success in this field. In a world where the threat of cyber attacks and data breaches is constantly evolving, it is crucial that investigators and security professionals have access to the most advanced tools and resources to help protect their clients and organizations.

One of the main benefits of using open-source technology is the ability to constantly update and improve upon existing tools and systems. Traditional proprietary software often requires costly updates and can quickly become outdated, leaving investigators and security professionals vulnerable to new threats. With open-source technology, the community of developers and users can collaborate and continuously improve upon the technology, ensuring that it remains effective in defending against emerging threats.

But beyond just the technical benefits, I believe that small businesses will play an integral role in the future of the investigation and security services industry. With the rise of freelancers and independent contractors, more and more small businesses are being created to provide specialized services to clients. These small businesses often have a strong focus on customer service and are able to provide more personalized, tailored solutions to their clients, which can be incredibly valuable in the complex and constantly changing world of investigation and security.

As for how an investigator can thrive in this industry, I believe it is essential to stay up to date on the latest technology and trends, as well as building a strong network of contacts and resources. Staying informed and proactive in the face of evolving threats is crucial to success in this field, and building strong relationships with other professionals and organizations can help to open up new opportunities and resources.

Overall, the investigation and security services industry is an essential and constantly evolving field, and the use of open-source technology and the growth of small businesses will continue to play a vital role in its success. By staying informed, proactive, and focused on customer service, investigators and security professionals can thrive in this industry and help to protect their clients and organizations from the many threats they face.

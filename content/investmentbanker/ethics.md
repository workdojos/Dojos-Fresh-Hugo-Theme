As a philosopher, I would approach this question by first considering the fundamental ethical principles that should guide any career. These might include concepts like honesty, integrity, fairness, and responsibility. From there, I would consider the specific challenges and ethical dilemmas that might arise in the context of a career as an investment banker. This might include questions around conflicts of interest, the proper use of insider information, the ethical implications of financial risk-taking, and the responsibility to act in the best interests of clients and stakeholders.

To develop an ethical framework for starting a career as an investment banker, I might also consider the ethical theories and perspectives of influential philosophers like John Rawls, Immanuel Kant, and Jeremy Bentham. These philosophers have all grappled with questions around fairness, justice, and the common good, and their insights could be helpful in thinking through the ethical challenges of a career in finance.

Ultimately, the ethical framework that I would propose for a career in investment banking would be one that prioritizes the principles of honesty, integrity, fairness, and responsibility, while also recognizing the complexity and nuance of the financial world. This framework would encourage bankers to act with integrity and transparency, and to always seek to act in the best interests of their clients and stakeholders.

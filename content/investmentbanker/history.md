The word "investment" comes from the Latin "investire," which means "to clothe." This meaning likely comes from the idea of investing in clothing or other personal possessions. The word "banker" comes from the Italian "banco," which refers to the bench or counter where money was exchanged in medieval Italy. The word "financial" comes from the Latin "financiarius," which refers to someone who manages finances.

The term "investment banker" refers to a person or company that works in the financial industry, specifically in the area of investment. This includes activities such as buying and selling securities, providing financial advice, and managing investments for clients.

The term "financial services" refers to a wide range of services related to managing and investing money. This includes activities such as banking, insurance, investment, and financial planning.

Over time, the meanings of these words have remained largely unchanged, though the specific activities and industries associated with them have evolved and expanded.

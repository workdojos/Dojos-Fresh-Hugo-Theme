This presents a good opportunity for jewelers who are able to adapt to changing market trends and offer unique, high-quality products.

As far as qualifications go, it would be beneficial for you to pursue a degree or certification in jewelry design, repair, or sales. There are many programs available at universities and vocational schools that offer these types of courses. You could also consider internships or apprenticeships to gain hands-on experience in the industry.

In conclusion, based on your skills, interests, and experience, a potential career as a jeweler in the luxury goods industry may be a good fit for you. I recommend exploring different programs and opportunities to gain the necessary qualifications and experience in the field.

Jeweler:

The word "jeweler" comes from the Old French word "joiailler," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "joculator," meaning "jester" or "entertainer." This word was used in the Middle Ages to refer to individuals who made and sold decorative objects, including jewelry.

Over time, the meaning of the word "jeweler" narrowed to specifically refer to someone who designs, manufactures, or sells jewelry. Today, a jeweler is typically someone who specializes in the creation, repair, and sale of jewelry, as well as other decorative items such as watches and precious stones.

Luxury goods:

The word "luxury" comes from the Latin word "luxuria," which means "excess" or "extravagance." In the Middle Ages, luxury goods were associated with the wealthy and were seen as a sign of social status. These goods were typically imported from other countries and were expensive due to their rarity and high quality.

Today, luxury goods are still seen as a symbol of wealth and status, but they can refer to a wide range of items, including clothing, jewelry, cars, and even experiences. The definition of luxury goods has also broadened to include products that are considered high-end due to their quality, craftsmanship, or exclusivity, rather than just their price.

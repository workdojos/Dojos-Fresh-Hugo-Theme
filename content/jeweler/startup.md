Potential Business Challenges: LuxeJewels may face competition from established luxury jewelers and from counterfeit products. LuxeJewels will need to carefully curate its selection and authenticate all products to differentiate itself and maintain a reputation for quality. LuxeJewels will also need to effectively market itself and build a loyal customer base in a crowded and competitive market.

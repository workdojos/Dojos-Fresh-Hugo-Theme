The word "job seeker" can be traced back to the Old English word "scearu," which means "inquiry" or "inquire." This word eventually evolved into the Middle English word "sker," which meant "inquire" or "seek." In the early 16th century, the word "sker" was combined with the word "job," which referred to a specific task or piece of work, to create the phrase "job sker," or "one who seeks a job."

The word "recruitment" has a similar etymology. It can be traced back to the Latin word "recrues," which means "fresh troops" or "newly raised soldiers." This word eventually evolved into the French word "recrute," which means "to recruit." In English, the word "recruitment" was first used in the early 17th century to refer to the process of enlisting or hiring new soldiers or workers.

Over time, the meanings of both "job seeker" and "recruitment" have remained relatively unchanged. However, the contexts in which these words are used have expanded to include a wider range of occupations and industries. For example, "job seeker" is now used to refer to anyone seeking employment, regardless of the type of work they are seeking. Similarly, "recruitment" is now used to refer to the process of hiring or enlisting employees in a variety of industries, not just the military.

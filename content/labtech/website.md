As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for a few reasons. First, open-source technology is generally free to use and customize, which can save your business a significant amount of money in terms of website development costs. Additionally, open-source technology is usually highly customizable and can be tailored to your specific needs and business goals. This can be especially useful for a lab tech working in the laboratory testing industry, as you may have unique requirements for your website that are not easily accommodated by off-the-shelf solutions.

There are several popular open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other apps that can be used to create a great user experience for your website. Some of the leading options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which are all powerful content management systems that can be used to build dynamic, feature-rich websites. Other popular options include static-site generators like Jekyll and Hugo, which allow you to build a fast and lightweight website that is easy to maintain and update.

There are also several other open-source apps that can be used to enhance your website and provide a great overall experience for your users. Some examples include chatbots, email marketing platforms, and e-commerce solutions like WooCommerce.

While there are many benefits to using open-source technology to build your own website, there are also some potential downsides to consider. One potential downside is that open-source technology may require more technical expertise to set up and maintain, as you will need to be responsible for configuring and managing the various tools and components of your website. Additionally, open-source technology may not always offer the same level of support and documentation as proprietary solutions, which can make it more difficult to troubleshoot issues or get help when you need it.

Overall, the pros and cons of using open-source technology to build your own website will depend on your specific business needs and goals. If you are willing to invest the time and effort required to set up and maintain an open-source website, it can be a cost-effective and highly customizable solution that can help you meet your business objectives. If you prefer a more turnkey solution or do not have the technical expertise to manage an open-source website, you may want to consider using a proprietary website builder or hiring a professional web design firm to handle the development process for you.

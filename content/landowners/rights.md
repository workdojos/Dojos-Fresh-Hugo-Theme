As a debater, I believe that fair work practices are essential for any industry, including the real estate industry. Landowners and speculators have a responsibility to ensure that their workers are treated fairly and given proper wages for their labor. In recent years, there have been several trends and events in the real estate industry that highlight the need for fair work practices.

One trend that has emerged in the real estate industry is the increasing reliance on temporary or contract workers. While this may seem like a cost-effective solution for landowners and speculators, it often leads to workers being denied basic rights and protections that full-time employees receive. For example, temporary workers may not have access to health insurance or retirement benefits, and they may not be protected by anti-discrimination laws. This is unacceptable, and it is important that we advocate for fair treatment and proper wages for all workers, regardless of their employment status.

Another event that highlights the need for fair work practices in the real estate industry is the COVID-19 pandemic. Many workers in this industry have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, with many losing their jobs or experiencing reduced hours. Landowners and speculators have a responsibility to ensure that their workers are protected during this time, whether through providing hazard pay or offering additional support to those who have been affected by the pandemic.

In conclusion, fair work practices are essential for the real estate industry. Landowners and speculators have a responsibility to ensure that their workers are treated fairly, given proper wages, and protected from discrimination and other forms of unfair treatment. By advocating for fair work practices, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.

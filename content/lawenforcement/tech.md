As someone who has worked in the protective services industry for several years, I can say firsthand that the need for open-source technology is becoming increasingly important. With the advancement of technology, there is an expectation for law enforcement agencies to keep up with the times and utilize tools that can aid in their duties.

One of the main benefits of open-source technology is that it allows for more collaboration and sharing of information within the industry. It allows for agencies to communicate and share resources more efficiently, which can ultimately lead to a more effective and efficient protective services system.

But open-source technology isn't just beneficial for agencies - it can also be a valuable tool for individual police officers. In a field where every second counts, having access to technology that can assist in decision-making and quick response times can save lives. It can also help officers feel more confident and equipped to handle situations, which can ultimately lead to a better sense of job satisfaction.

However, it's not just large agencies that should be utilizing open-source technology. Small businesses in the protective services industry can also play a crucial role in the economy. These businesses can provide innovative solutions and technology to agencies and individuals, creating new job opportunities and contributing to the overall growth of the industry.

In order to thrive in the protective services industry, it's important for both individuals and businesses to adapt to new technologies and stay current with the changing landscape. By embracing open-source technology, we can create a more efficient and effective system that serves and protects our communities.

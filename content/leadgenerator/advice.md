As a career counselor, it is my job to help individuals like you determine the best career path based on your skills, interests, and experience. From what you have told me, it sounds like you are interested in pursuing a career as a lead generator in the marketing services industry.

Before we dive into the specifics of this career path, it is important to conduct some research into the job market trends in the marketing services industry. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment of marketing professionals is expected to grow by 8% from 2019 to 2029, faster than the average for all occupations. This growth is driven by the increasing use of digital marketing and the need for companies to reach and engage with consumers through various online channels.

In terms of the role of a lead generator in the marketing services industry, your primary responsibility would be to identify and generate leads for the sales team by researching potential clients and reaching out to them to initiate a conversation about the company's products or services. You would also be responsible for managing and updating a database of leads, tracking their progress through the sales cycle, and providing regular reports to management on the status of your lead generation efforts.

To be successful in this role, it is important that you have strong communication and research skills, as well as the ability to effectively manage your time and prioritize tasks. You should also be comfortable using various digital tools and platforms to conduct research and reach out to potential clients.

In terms of qualifications, a bachelor's degree in marketing, business, or a related field would be beneficial for pursuing a career as a lead generator in the marketing services industry. Additionally, obtaining a certification such as the Digital Marketing Certified Associate (DMCA) or the Google Analytics Individual Qualification (GAIQ) could also help to set you apart in the job market.

Overall, a career as a lead generator in the marketing services industry can be a rewarding and challenging path for individuals with strong communication, research, and time management skills. I recommend continuing to research the job market trends and industry-specific qualifications to determine if this is the right career path for you.

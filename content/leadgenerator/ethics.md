As a philosopher, I would approach this problem by first examining the fundamental principles of ethics that are applicable to any career or profession. These principles might include concepts such as respect for autonomy and informed consent, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice.

Next, I would consider the specific ethical challenges and dilemmas that may arise in the role of a lead generator working in the marketing services industry. For example, how can one balance the need to generate leads and drive sales with the responsibility to respect the privacy and autonomy of potential customers? How can one ensure that marketing campaigns are fair and just, and do not disproportionately benefit or harm certain groups of people?

To develop an ethical framework for this role, I would consider the values and goals of the marketing services industry, as well as the ethical principles outlined above. I might also look to the codes of conduct or ethical guidelines of professional organizations in this field, as well as the laws and regulations that govern marketing practices.

Ultimately, my ethical framework for a career as a lead generator in the marketing services industry would be based on a commitment to honesty, transparency, and respect for the rights and well-being of all stakeholders. This might involve creating clear guidelines for how leads are generated, how customer data is collected and used, and how marketing campaigns are designed and implemented. It might also involve seeking out opportunities to educate and empower customers, and to engage in ethical problem-solving when challenges or dilemmas arise.

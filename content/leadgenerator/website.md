As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for a few reasons. First, open-source technology is often free to use, which can be a major cost-saving advantage for your business. Additionally, using open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization options in the development of your website. This can be especially useful in the marketing services industry, where you may want to tailor your website to meet the specific needs and goals of your clients.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that you may want to consider for your website. Some examples include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which are all widely used for building and managing websites. Each of these platforms has its own pros and cons, so it's important to carefully consider which one is the best fit for your business.

In terms of static-site generators, some popular options include Gatsby, Jekyll, and Hugo. These tools allow you to create static websites that are fast, secure, and easy to manage. They are also often more cost-effective than traditional web builders, as they don't require ongoing maintenance or hosting fees.

Other open-source apps that you may want to consider for your website include content management systems (CMS) like WordPress or Drupal, e-commerce platforms like Magento or WooCommerce, and analytics tools like Google Analytics.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology for your website include cost savings, flexibility, and the ability to customize your website to meet your specific business needs. However, it's important to keep in mind that open-source technology may require more technical expertise to set up and maintain, and may not be as user-friendly as some proprietary options. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on your specific business goals and needs.

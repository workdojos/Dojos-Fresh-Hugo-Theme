HISThe word "legislator" comes from the Latin word "legislator," which means "lawmaker." The root of this word is "legis," which means "law," and "lator," which means "one who carries or brings." The word has been in use in English since the 16th century and refers to a person who makes laws, especially in a government or other political body.

The word "legislative" also comes from the Latin "legislativus," which means "relating to legislation." This word is derived from the same root as "legislator," "legis," meaning "law," and "ativus," which means "having the power or authority to do something." In English, the word "legislative" refers to the act or process of making laws, especially in a government or other political body.

Over time, the meanings of both "legislator" and "legislative" have remained relatively unchanged. However, the use of these words has expanded to encompass not only the creation of laws, but also the enforcement and interpretation of them.

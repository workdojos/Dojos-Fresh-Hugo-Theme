As a philosopher, I would recommend starting by considering what values are most important to you in your work as a liaison. Do you value honesty, integrity, fairness, justice, or other principles? These values can serve as the foundation for your ethical framework, guiding your actions and decision-making in your career.

Next, consider the specific ethical challenges that may arise in the international relations industry. For example, you may encounter situations where you need to balance the interests of different stakeholders, such as governments, businesses, or civil society organizations. How will you prioritize these interests and make decisions that are ethical and fair?

One approach to ethical decision-making in this context is to consider the potential consequences of your actions on different groups of people. This could involve considering the principle of utility, which holds that the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or well-being. Alternatively, you could consider deontological ethics, which hold that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences.

In addition to these theoretical frameworks, it may also be helpful to seek guidance from professional codes of ethics, such as those adopted by professional associations or international organizations. These codes can provide specific guidance on ethical issues that are relevant to your field, such as confidentiality, conflict of interest, and transparency.

Ultimately, the ethical framework that you develop for your career will depend on your own values and the specific challenges you face in your work as a liaison. However, by considering these key philosophical concepts and seeking guidance from professional codes of ethics, you can develop a framework that helps you navigate ethical dilemmas and make decisions that are fair, just, and in line with your values.

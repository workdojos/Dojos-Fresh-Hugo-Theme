Liaison: The word "liaison" comes from the French word "liaison," which means "link." It originally referred to the act of connecting or linking two things together. It was first used in English in the early 19th century in the field of military communications, where it referred to the act of connecting two military units or departments.

Over time, the meaning of the word has expanded to refer to any kind of connection or relationship between two or more people or groups. It can refer to a personal or professional relationship, or a formal arrangement between two organizations.

International relations: The phrase "international relations" refers to the relationships and interactions between different countries or international organizations. It is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of issues, including diplomacy, trade, security, and cultural exchange.

The origins of the phrase "international relations" can be traced back to the late 19th century, when it was first used to describe the study of international politics and diplomacy. At that time, the term was used to describe the study of the relationships between different nations and the ways in which they interacted with one another. Today, the term is used to describe a wide range of activities and interactions between countries and international organizations.

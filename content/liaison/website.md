As a web design consultant, I would suggest that using open-source technology to build your own website can be a great option for your business in the international relations industry. There are several benefits to using open-source technology, including:

Cost: One of the main benefits of using open-source technology is that it is often free to use. This can be a huge cost-saving for your business, especially when compared to proprietary software which can be expensive to purchase and maintain.

Customizability: Another benefit of open-source technology is that you have the ability to customize and modify the code to meet your specific needs. This can be especially useful for businesses in the international relations industry, as you may need to tailor the website to meet the specific needs of your clients and stakeholders.

Community support: Another advantage of using open-source technology is that it is often supported by a large and active community of developers. This means that you can get help and support from others who are using the same tools, which can be very useful when you are building and maintaining your website.

Some popular open-source web builders that you might consider using include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. Static-site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo can also be useful for creating simple websites that are easy to maintain. Other popular open-source apps that could be useful for your business include CRM systems, project management tools, and content management systems.

There are also some potential drawbacks to using open-source technology, such as the potential for security vulnerabilities and the need for additional resources to customize and maintain the website. However, these risks can be mitigated by following best practices for security and keeping the website up to date with the latest patches and updates.

In terms of cost, using open-source technology can be a cost-effective option for building and maintaining a website, especially when compared to proprietary software. However, you may still need to invest in hosting, domain registration, and other related costs in order to get your website up and running.

Overall, I would recommend considering the use of open-source technology as a viable option for building and maintaining your website in the international relations industry. With the right tools and resources, you can create a user-friendly and effective website that meets your business goals and enhances the user experience.

As a philosopher, one could approach this question by examining various ethical theories and determining which one best aligns with the values and goals of the life coaching industry. For example, one could consider the principles of deontology, which emphasizes the importance of acting in accordance with moral duties and rules. In the context of life coaching, this could involve treating clients with respect and upholding confidentiality, even when it may be inconvenient or challenging to do so.

Another ethical theory to consider is consequentialism, which holds that the right action is the one that leads to the most favorable consequences for all involved. In the life coaching industry, this could involve maximizing the positive impact on clients' lives by helping them achieve their goals and improve their well-being.

One could also consider the ethical principles of virtue ethics, which emphasizes the importance of cultivating and demonstrating virtues such as honesty, compassion, and fairness. This could involve being honest and transparent with clients about one's qualifications and limitations as a life coach, and being compassionate and understanding of their struggles and challenges.

Ultimately, the ethical framework for starting a career as a life coach will depend on the specific values and goals of the individual and the industry as a whole. It is important to carefully consider the various ethical theories and principles and determine which ones align with one's own values and goals as a life coach, as well as the needs and expectations of clients.

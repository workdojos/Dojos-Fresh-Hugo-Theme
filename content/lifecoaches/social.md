Sure! Here are some ideas for an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, and Pinterest to promote your new business as a life coach:

Instagram: Create a series of Instagram posts featuring quotes or tips related to life coaching, with accompanying graphics and hashtags. Encourage followers to share their own experiences or ask for advice in the comments. Consider hosting a Q&A or Instagram Live session to further engage with your audience.

Twitter: Share short, inspiring tweets related to life coaching and encourage followers to retweet or share their own thoughts. Use relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience and participate in Twitter chats related to the life coaching industry.

Youtube: Create a series of Youtube videos offering tips and advice on different aspects of life coaching. Consider hosting a webinar or workshop to further engage with your audience and provide value to potential clients.

Pinterest: Create Pinterest boards featuring quotes, tips, and resources related to life coaching. Share your own pins as well as those from other industry experts to create a well-rounded resource for your followers. Use relevant hashtags and participate in Pinterest group boards to reach a wider audience.

Overall, the key is to consistently create engaging content that adds value to your followers and helps them see the benefits of working with a life coach. Consider offering promotions or discounts to followers who engage with your content and encourage them to share it with their own followers.

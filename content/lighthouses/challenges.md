One of the biggest issues is the lack of access to legal representation for those who cannot afford it, leading to a system that is stacked in favor of the wealthy. This is a problem that needs to be addressed in order to create a more equitable and fair justice system.

Another challenge facing the legal industry is the difficulty that many lawyers face in finding work.

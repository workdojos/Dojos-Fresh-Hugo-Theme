The word "logistics" comes from the Greek word "logistikos," which means "skilled in calculating." It was originally used to describe the art of calculating and planning military campaigns. The word "manager" comes from the Latin "manu agere," which means "to handle."

The term "logistics manager" first appeared in the mid-20th century as a way to describe someone who was responsible for managing the logistics of a company or organization. This included planning and coordinating the movement of goods, materials, and resources within a supply chain.

Over time, the role of a logistics manager has evolved to include a wider range of responsibilities, such as managing inventory, forecasting demand, and optimizing transportation routes. Today, logistics managers play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth operation and efficiency of businesses and organizations.

Using open-source technology to build your own website can offer several benefits. Here are a few:

Cost-effective: One of the main benefits of using open-source technology is that it is usually free to use. This means that you can save a lot of money on licensing fees, as compared to using proprietary software.

Customizable: Open-source technology is usually highly customizable, which means that you can modify and adapt it to meet the specific needs of your business. This is especially useful if you have specific requirements that may not be met by off-the-shelf solutions.

Large community support: There is usually a large community of developers and users supporting open-source projects, which means that you can get help and support from others who are using the same technology.

Flexibility: Open-source technology is often more flexible than proprietary solutions, as it allows you to make changes and improvements to the source code. This can be useful if you need to make changes to the way the software works or add new features.

As far as building a website for your logistics business, some popular open-source web builders that you might consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms are widely used and offer a wide range of features and tools to help you create a professional-looking website.

Static-site generators, such as Jekyll, Hexo, and Gatsby, are another option for building a website. These tools allow you to create a website using plain text files, rather than a database, which can make them easier to manage and more secure.

Other popular open-source apps that you might find useful for your logistics business include project management tools like Trello and Asana, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems like SugarCRM and Salesforce.

It's worth noting that using open-source technology does have some potential drawbacks. For example, you may need to invest more time and resources into customizing and maintaining the software, as you won't have access to the same level of support and resources as you would with a proprietary solution. Additionally, you may need to have a certain level of technical expertise in order to effectively use and customize open-source technology.

Overall, the decision to use open-source technology will depend on the specific needs and resources of your business. It can be a cost-effective and flexible option, but it may require more time and expertise to set up and maintain.

Lyricist:
The word lyricist comes from the Greek word "lyrikos," which means "singing to the lyre." The lyre was a stringed instrument similar to a small harp, and it was often used to accompany singing in ancient Greek culture. In modern English, a lyricist is a person who writes lyrics for songs, poems, or other forms of written expression.

The meaning of the word lyricist has remained relatively unchanged over time, though it has evolved to refer specifically to song lyrics rather than all forms of written expression.

Music:
The word music comes from the Greek word "mousike," which means "art of the Muses." In ancient Greek culture, the Muses were the nine daughters of Zeus who were believed to inspire all forms of artistic expression, including music. In modern English, music refers to an art form consisting of sound and silence, organized in time and often combined with rhythms, melodies, and harmonies.

The meaning of the word music has remained relatively unchanged over time, though the definition has been expanded to encompass a wide range of musical styles and traditions from around the world.

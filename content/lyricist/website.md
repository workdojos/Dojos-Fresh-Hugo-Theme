As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for a greater level of customization and flexibility in the design and functionality of your website. This means you can tailor the website to meet the specific needs and goals of your business as a lyricist in the music industry. Additionally, open-source technology typically has a large community of developers and users who contribute to and support the technology, making it easier to find solutions to any issues or challenges you may encounter during the development process.

Some of the leading open-source web builders that could be suitable for your website include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These web builders offer a range of features and tools for building and managing a website, including templates, content management systems, and plugins for adding additional functionality.

Static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, are another option to consider if you want a fast-loading and secure website. These tools generate a website from plain text files, rather than a database, making them easier to deploy and maintain.

Other popular open-source apps that could be useful for your website include e-commerce platforms like Magento and WooCommerce, and social media integration tools like Hootsuite and Buffer.

In terms of the pros and cons of using open-source technology, one of the main benefits is the ability to customize and tailor the website to your specific needs. However, it may require a greater level of technical expertise or the hiring of a developer to fully utilize the technology. Additionally, while open-source technology is often free to use, there may be costs associated with hosting and maintaining the website.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your website can provide a highly customizable and flexible platform for your business as a lyricist in the music industry. It is important to carefully consider the options and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.

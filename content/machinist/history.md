The word "machinist" has its roots in the Latin word "machinarius", which means "engineer". The word "machinarius" is derived from the Latin word "machina", which means "machine". The word "machinarius" was first used in the English language in the early 16th century to refer to a person who operated or maintained a machine.

The word "machining" comes from the verb "to machine", which means "to shape or form metal or other materials using a machine". The verb "to machine" is derived from the noun "machine", which comes from the Latin "machina". The verb "to machine" was first used in the English language in the early 19th century, when the industrial revolution was in full swing and machines were becoming more prevalent in the manufacturing process.

Over time, the meanings of both "machinist" and "machining" have remained relatively consistent, although the specific machines and technologies used in machining have evolved and improved. Today, a machinist is typically someone who is skilled in operating and maintaining machines that cut, shape, or form materials, while machining refers to the process of using these machines to shape or form materials.

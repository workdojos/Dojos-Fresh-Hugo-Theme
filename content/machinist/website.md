As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, open-source technology is often more cost-effective than proprietary options. This is because you don't have to pay for licenses or subscriptions to use the software, and you can often access a wide range of free resources and support from the open-source community.

In addition, open-source technology is generally more flexible and customizable than proprietary options. This is because the source code is open and available for you to modify and adapt to your specific needs. This can be especially useful if you have specific requirements or features that you want to include on your website.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that you could consider using, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and functionality, and can be easily customized to meet your specific needs.

There are also a number of other open-source apps that you could consider using to enhance your website, such as forums, e-commerce platforms, and customer relationship management tools. These can help you to build a more comprehensive and user-friendly website that meets the needs of both your business and your customers.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your website far outweigh the potential drawbacks. It is generally more cost-effective, flexible, and customizable than proprietary options, and can help you to build a website that meets the needs of your business and your customers.

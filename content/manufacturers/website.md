As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons. One of the main benefits is that open-source technology is usually free to use and distribute, which can save your business a significant amount of money compared to using proprietary software.

Additionally, open-source technology is often more flexible and customizable than proprietary software, which allows you to tailor the website to your specific needs and goals. This can be especially beneficial for a manufacturing company, as you may have unique requirements for your website that are not addressed by off-the-shelf solutions.

Some popular open-source web builders that you may want to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms are user-friendly and offer a wide range of features and functionality, including customizable templates, easy-to-use content management systems, and integrations with popular marketing tools.

Static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, are another option to consider if you want a more lightweight and faster-loading website. These tools generate static HTML files, rather than dynamically rendering content on the server, which can lead to faster page load times and lower hosting costs.

Other open-source apps that you may want to consider include e-commerce solutions like Magento and WooCommerce, as well as customer relationship management tools like SugarCRM and vTiger. These tools can help you streamline your business processes and improve customer engagement.

Overall, the main pro of using open-source technology is the cost savings and flexibility it offers. However, it is important to keep in mind that using open-source technology does require some technical knowledge and resources, such as hosting and maintenance. It may also require more upfront time and effort to set up and customize the website, compared to using a fully-hosted solution. However, the long-term benefits of using open-source technology, such as the ability to fully customize the website to your needs and the potential for cost savings, often outweigh the initial investment.

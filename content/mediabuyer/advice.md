First of all, it's great that you are considering a career as a media buyer in the advertising industry. Media buyers are responsible for negotiating and purchasing advertising space on behalf of clients, so it's important to have strong communication and negotiation skills as well as an understanding of the advertising industry.

To determine if this is the right career for you, it's important to consider your skills, interests and experience. Do you enjoy working with numbers and analyzing data? Do you have a strong attention to detail and the ability to multitask? Do you have a keen interest in media and advertising? If you answered yes to these questions, a career as a media buyer may be a good fit for you.

In terms of the job market, the advertising industry is constantly evolving, so it's important to stay up to date with trends and changes. Currently, the trend towards digital advertising and social media marketing is growing, so having a strong understanding of these platforms and how to effectively target and reach audiences through them would be beneficial.

In terms of qualifications, a bachelor's degree in advertising, marketing or a related field would be helpful in securing a position as a media buyer. Many employers also look for candidates with a background in business or economics. Additionally, obtaining a certification such as the Media Buying Professional (MBP) from the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) can also enhance your credentials and make you a more competitive candidate.

Overall, a career as a media buyer can be rewarding and challenging, but with the right skills, interests and qualifications, it can be a great fit for those looking to work in the advertising industry. I hope this information has been helpful, and I encourage you to continue researching and learning about the media buying field to determine if it is the right career path for you.

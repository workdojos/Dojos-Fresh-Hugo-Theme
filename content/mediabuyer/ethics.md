As a philosopher, I would approach this task by first considering the fundamental principles of ethical theory and how they apply to the advertising industry.

One important principle to consider is the concept of autonomy, or the idea that individuals have the right to make their own decisions and take responsibility for the consequences of those decisions. This principle would suggest that media buyers should be free to pursue their careers as they see fit, as long as they are not harming others or infringing on their autonomy.

Another principle to consider is the idea of fairness, or the idea that individuals should be treated equally and justly. This principle would suggest that media buyers should be mindful of the potential for bias in the advertising industry, and strive to ensure that their actions do not unfairly advantage or disadvantage certain groups of people.

Additionally, the principle of utility, or the idea that actions should be guided by a desire to maximize the overall good, would suggest that media buyers should consider the potential consequences of their actions on society as a whole. This could involve considering the potential impact of the advertisements they create on public health, social values, and other important issues.

Ultimately, developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a media buyer will require considering a range of different principles and values, and finding a balance between them that reflects your personal beliefs and goals. It may also involve seeking out guidance from others in the industry, such as mentors or professional organizations, and engaging in ongoing self-reflection and self-improvement to ensure that you are meeting your ethical obligations as a media buyer.

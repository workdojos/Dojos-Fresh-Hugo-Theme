Sure! Here are some ideas for an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, and Pinterest to promote your new business as a media buyer in the advertising industry:

On Instagram, create visually appealing graphics or videos showcasing the types of ads you have worked on in the past. Use relevant hashtags to increase the reach of your content. Engage with your followers by asking for their opinions on the ads you have created and offering tips and tricks for media buying.

On Twitter, share industry news and updates, as well as your own insights and experiences as a media buyer. Use Twitter polls to gather feedback from your followers and engage with other industry professionals by commenting on their tweets.

On Youtube, create video tutorials or behind-the-scenes looks at your work as a media buyer. Offer valuable tips and insights that will help other professionals in the industry improve their skills. Engage with your viewers by answering their questions and responding to their comments.

On Pinterest, create boards featuring examples of successful ad campaigns that you have worked on. Include relevant keywords and hashtags in your board titles and descriptions to increase the visibility of your content. Engage with your followers by commenting on their pins and sharing their content.

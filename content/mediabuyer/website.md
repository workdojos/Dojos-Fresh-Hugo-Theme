As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology for your website for several reasons. First and foremost, using open-source technology allows you to have full control over the design and functionality of your website, as you can customize it to meet your specific needs and preferences. This is especially important for a media buyer working in the advertising industry, as you may have specific requirements for your website that may not be easily met with a pre-designed template or platform.

In addition, using open-source technology can help you save money on website development costs, as you can utilize free or low-cost tools and resources to build your website. This is especially important for businesses on a tight budget or with limited resources.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that can be used to create a professional and user-friendly website. Some of the leading options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which are widely used by businesses of all sizes and industries. These platforms offer a wide range of features and customization options, and can be easily updated and maintained.

Other popular open-source apps that can enhance the user experience of your website include e-commerce solutions like Magento and WooCommerce, and content management systems like WordPress and Drupal. These tools can help you easily manage and update your website content, as well as integrate with other business systems and platforms.

Overall, using open-source technology for your website has several benefits, including greater control and customization, cost-effectiveness, and access to a wide range of tools and resources. However, it is important to consider the pros and cons and costs of each option, and to carefully assess your specific needs and goals before making a decision. A web design consultant can help you evaluate your options and choose the best solution for your business.

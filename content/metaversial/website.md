As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for a few reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for flexibility and customization, which can be particularly useful for a business in the metaverse and VR industry. By using open-source technology, you can tailor the website to meet your specific needs and goals, rather than being limited to pre-designed templates or features. Additionally, open-source technology often has a strong community of developers who contribute to its development, meaning that there is a wealth of knowledge and resources available to assist with the building process.

There are several open-source web builders and static-site generators that could be suitable for your project, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a range of features and tools to help you create a professional and user-friendly website. Additionally, there are a number of popular open-source apps that could enhance the overall experience of your website, such as chatbots, analytics tools, and content management systems.

One potential downside to using open-source technology is the need for technical knowledge and expertise to set up and manage the website. However, this can also be seen as an advantage, as it allows you, as a developer, to have full control over the website and its features. Additionally, using open-source technology can often be more cost-effective than purchasing proprietary software or hiring a web design agency, as there are typically no licensing fees involved.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can offer a high level of flexibility and customization, as well as access to a supportive community of developers. It can also be a cost-effective option for businesses looking to create a professional and user-friendly website.

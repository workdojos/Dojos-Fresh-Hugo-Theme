# Mission // #Academic Workplace Revolution

**Project Brief**: Academic Workplace Revolution

**Team Leader**: Liz

**Assignment**: To develop a comprehensive solution to address the challenges faced by academics in their daily work environment.

**Goals**:

To improve the efficiency and productivity of academics in their work environment
To provide a better work-life balance for academics
To create a more supportive and inclusive work culture for academics
**Stakes**:

The academic community is facing an increasing workload, with a growing demand for research and publishing. This has led to burnout, high stress levels, and a lack of work-life balance for many academics.
This can have negative consequences for academic institutions, including a decline in research output and a decrease in the quality of education provided to students.
If the challenges faced by academics are not addressed, it could lead to a talent drain from the academic community, further exacerbating the issues.
**Reserves**:

Access to relevant academic research and data
Time and resources to develop and implement solutions
Access to technology and tools to support remote working
A team of academics with a diverse range of expertise and perspectives
Success Criteria:

The development of a comprehensive solution that addresses the challenges faced by academics in their work environment
The solution should improve the efficiency and productivity of academics, provide a better work-life balance, and create a more supportive and inclusive work culture.
The solution should be tested and validated with academics, and if successful, be implemented in academic institutions worldwide.
Rewards:

All contributing members will receive XP points, which will contribute to their overall score and unlock new challenges in the ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for academics worldwide.
The successful completion of this project will contribute to the overall goal of creating a more supportive and inclusive work environment for academics, which will have real-world consequences for academia and positively impact the lives of academics worldwide.

**Stakes**:
The success of this project will have real-world consequences for the art industry. If we fail to solve the issue, the industry will continue to face challenges that hinder its growth and impact its stakeholders. Our work will contribute to the growth and development of the industry, and create a positive impact on the lives of artists, collectors, and art enthusiasts.

Our team will have access to the following resources to complete this project:

Access to industry experts and stakeholders to gain insight into the challenges facing the art industry.

# Mission // #Art Industry Revolution

**Project Brief**: Art Industry Revolution

**Team Leader**: Jessi

**Assignment**: The art industry is facing several challenges in today's fast-paced world. Our team of curators will work together to solve one of the most pressing issues in the industry within 90 days. We will work remotely from our PC's at home to ensure that the project is completed on time.

**Goals**:

To identify the biggest challenge in the art industry and propose a solution to address it.
To implement the solution in a way that positively impacts the art industry and its stakeholders.
To increase awareness of the challenges facing the art industry and create a movement towards positive change.

**Stakes**:
The success of this project will have real-world consequences for the art industry. If we fail to solve the issue, the industry will continue to face challenges that hinder its growth and impact its stakeholders. Our work will contribute to the growth and development of the industry, and create a positive impact on the lives of artists, collectors, and art enthusiasts.

Our team will have access to the following resources to complete this project:

Access to industry experts and stakeholders to gain insight into the challenges facing the art industry.

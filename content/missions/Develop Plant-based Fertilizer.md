# Mission // #Develop Plant-based Fertilizer

**Project Brief**
Title: Development of a new plant-based fertilizer
**Team Leader**: Rebecca
**Assignment**: To develop a new plant-based fertilizer that is environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and provides optimal growth for crops.

**Goals**:

Research and analyze existing plant-based fertilizers in the market.
Identify the key ingredients and methods used in the production of these fertilizers.
Develop a formula for a new plant-based fertilizer that offers better results in terms of crop growth and yield.
Test the new fertilizer on different crops to validate its effectiveness.
Present a comprehensive report on the research, development, and testing of the new fertilizer.
**Stakes**:

A successful completion of the project would increase the competitiveness of the biosciences industry and lead to a more sustainable and profitable future.
The new fertilizer could potentially be a game-changer in the agriculture industry, providing farmers with a more eco-friendly alternative to traditional fertilizers.
A failure to complete the project would result in a loss of credibility for the team and the biosciences industry.
**Reserves**:

Access to relevant research material and databases for information gathering.
Access to a laboratory for testing purposes.
Access to relevant software for data analysis and report writing.
A budget for the purchase of materials and equipment required for the research and development of the new fertilizer.
Successful completion of the project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for biologists worldwide.

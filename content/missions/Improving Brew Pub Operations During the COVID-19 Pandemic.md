To create a comprehensive plan for brew pub owners to maintain financial stability during the pandemic and beyond.
**Stakes**:
The stakes are high for brew pub owners during the pandemic, as their livelihoods are on the line. The success of this project will have real-world consequences, and will determine the future of many businesses in this industry.

**Reserves**:
Each team member must allocate the necessary time and resources to complete their assigned tasks. This includes conducting research, collaborating with team members, and participating in virtual meetings and discussions. In order to ensure the success of the project, each team member must be fully committed and take ownership of their responsibilities.

Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for brew pub owners worldwide. The team will continue to work together to find solutions to the challenges facing the industry, and to help brew pub owners succeed in these uncertain times.

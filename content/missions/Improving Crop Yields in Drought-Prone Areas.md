# Mission // #Improving Crop Yields in Drought-Prone Areas

**Project Brief**: Improving Crop Yields in Drought-Prone Areas

**Team Leader**: Max

**Assignment**:
The agriculture industry is facing numerous challenges due to increasing droughts, particularly in drought-prone areas. This project aims to address this issue by finding new and innovative ways to improve crop yields in these regions. The team of agriculturists will work remotely from their PCs at home to find solutions to this pressing issue.

**Goals**:

To increase crop yields in drought-prone areas by 20% within 90 days.
To develop new irrigation methods that are more efficient and sustainable.
To find alternative crops that are drought-resistant and can be grown in these regions.
Stakes:
The agriculture industry is critical to the world's food supply and the success of this project will have real-world consequences. If the team is unable to find a solution to this issue, it will result in a decrease in food production, leading to food shortages and higher food prices. This will have a significant impact on the world's economy and the well-being of millions of people.

**Reserves**:
The team will have access to the latest research and technology, as well as a budget for equipment and resources. The team leader, Max, will also provide support and guidance throughout the project.

Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in the quest to revolutionize the workplace for agriculturists worldwide.

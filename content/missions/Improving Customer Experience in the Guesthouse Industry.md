**Project Brief**: Improving Customer Experience in the Guesthouse Industry

**Team Leader**: Gertrude
**Assignment**: To create a comprehensive plan to enhance the customer experience in the guesthouse industry, with a focus on improving guest satisfaction, increasing repeat business, and boosting brand reputation.

**Goals**:

Develop a customer feedback and engagement program that allows for real-time feedback from guests, and provides a platform for prompt and effective resolution of customer issues.
Create a loyalty program to reward repeat guests and increase brand loyalty.
Implement a comprehensive training program for all staff, focusing on customer service excellence, communication skills, and problem-solving.
Enhance guest room amenities and upgrade guest house facilities to meet customer needs and expectations.
Increase guest engagement through the creation of a guest directory and social media presence, and through the organization of guest-focused activities and events.
**Stakes**: The guesthouse industry is becoming increasingly competitive, and it is vital that guesthouses remain relevant and competitive. Improving the customer experience is key to achieving this, as it can increase customer satisfaction, repeat business, and brand reputation. The success of this project will directly impact the financial success of all participating guesthouses, and will set a new standard in the industry.

**Reserves**:

All team members will work remotely, and will be required to dedicate a minimum of 20 hours per week to the project.
A budget of $50 will be allocated for the implementation of the project, including the purchase of necessary materials and tools, and the compensation of any external consultants or experts.
All team members will be required to submit a weekly report to Gertrude outlining their progress and any issues they have encountered.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for guesthouse owners worldwide.

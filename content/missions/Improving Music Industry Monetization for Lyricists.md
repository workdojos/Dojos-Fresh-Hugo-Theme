**Project Brief**: Improving Music Industry Monetization for Lyricists

**Team Leader**: Derek

**Assignment**: The music industry has changed dramatically in recent years with the rise of digital streaming services, but many lyricists are still not receiving fair compensation for their work. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive plan to improve monetization for lyricists in the music industry.

**Goals**:

Conduct market research to understand the current state of monetization for lyricists.
Develop a detailed strategy for improving monetization for lyricists, including new revenue streams and alternative compensation models.
Work with key stakeholders in the music industry, including record labels, music publishers, and streaming services, to implement the plan.
Develop a comprehensive marketing plan to educate lyricists about their rights and the opportunities available to them.
Evaluate the impact of the plan and make any necessary adjustments to ensure long-term success.
**Stakes**:

If the team is successful, they will help improve the financial stability of lyricists in the music industry.
A successful project will also help increase public awareness about the importance of fair compensation for creative work.

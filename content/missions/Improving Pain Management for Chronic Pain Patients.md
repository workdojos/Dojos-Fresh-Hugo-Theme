# Mission // #Improving Pain Management for Chronic Pain Patients

**Project Brief**: Improving Pain Management for Chronic Pain Patients

**Team Leader**: Akiko

**Assignment**:
To design and implement a new, more effective approach to pain management for chronic pain patients. The current approach to treating chronic pain is often inadequate and leads to patients seeking more dangerous, addictive treatments. This project aims to provide patients with a safer, more effective solution for managing their pain.

**Goals**:

Develop a new approach to pain management for chronic pain patients that is both safe and effective.
Implement the new approach in select medical facilities in order to test its efficacy.
Gather data and evaluate the results of the implementation.
**Stakes**:
The success of this project is critical in improving the quality of life for chronic pain patients. The failure to develop an effective solution could lead to an increase in addiction to prescription painkillers and other dangerous treatments. The success of this project will also contribute to the team's XP and unlock new challenges in the quest to revolutionize the workplace for therapists worldwide.

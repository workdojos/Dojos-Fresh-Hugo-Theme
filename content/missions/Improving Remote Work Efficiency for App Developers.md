# Mission // #Improving Remote Work Efficiency for App Developers

**Project Brief**
Title: Improving Remote Work Efficiency for App Developers
**Team Leader**: Craig
**Assignment**: To develop a software solution that helps app developers work more efficiently while working remotely from their PCs at home.

**Goals**:

To reduce distractions and interruptions that hinder productivity while working remotely.
To streamline the communication and collaboration process between team members and stakeholders.
To improve the overall workflow and organization of tasks and projects.
**Stakes**:

Improving remote work efficiency for app developers is crucial for the growth and success of the software development industry.
With the increasing trend of remote work, it's essential to provide app developers with the necessary tools to be productive and efficient while working from home.
The lack of a solution for remote work efficiency will lead to decreased productivity and missed deadlines, which could result in project delays and loss of business.
**Reserves**:

The team will be working remotely and will have access to necessary tools and software to complete the project.
The team will have 90 days to complete the project and present a working solution.
Successful completion of the project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for app developers worldwide.
Note: The team will be required to provide regular updates on their progress and communicate with each other to ensure that the project is completed on time and to a high standard.

# Mission // #Improving Restaurant Operations in the New Normal

**Project Brief**: Improving Restaurant Operations in the New Normal

**Team Leader**: Michel

**Assignment**:
To improve the operations of restaurants in the new normal, where diners are facing challenges such as reduced foot traffic, increased safety protocols, and limited dine-in capacity.

**Goals**:

To increase the efficiency and profitability of restaurants.
To improve the safety and comfort of diners and employees.
To adapt to the changing needs of the restaurant industry.
Stakes:

The success of the restaurant industry is at stake, as the current challenges can lead to a decline in profits and even closures.
The health and safety of diners and employees are also at stake, as the new normal requires strict safety protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
**Reserves**:

Each team member will have access to their PC's at home to work remotely.
The team will have access to industry-leading software and tools to improve restaurant operations.
A budget of $50,000 has been allocated for the project, to be used for purchasing necessary tools and resources.
Successful completion of the project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for diner owners worldwide.

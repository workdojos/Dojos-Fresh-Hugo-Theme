# Mission // #Improving the Efficiency of Political Decision Making Processes

**Project Brief**: Improving the Efficiency of Political Decision Making Processes

**Team Leader**: Julia

**Assignment**: The team of politicians will work remotely from their PC's at home to improve the efficiency of the political decision making processes. The goal is to reduce the time it takes for decisions to be made and increase the accuracy of the decisions that are made.

**Goals**:

To streamline the decision making process and reduce the time it takes for decisions to be made by 50%
To increase the accuracy of the decisions that are made by 80%
To improve communication and collaboration among team members to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that decisions are made in a timely manner
**Stakes**:

If the team fails to meet the goals, they will lose the trust of the people and their constituents.
The reputation of the politics industry will be negatively impacted if the team fails to meet the goals.
The team will not receive the XP and unlock a new challenge in the quest to revolutionize the workplace for politicians worldwide if the goals are not met.
**Reserves**:

The team will have access to the latest technology and tools to help streamline the decision making process.
The team will receive training and support from experts in the field to help them reach the goals.
The team will have regular check-ins and updates from Julia to ensure that everyone is on track and that the project is moving forward as planned.

**Project Brief**: Improving the Impact of Spiritual Coaching in the Workplace

**Team Leader**: Giovanni

**Assignment**: The coaching industry is facing several challenges in terms of its impact on the workplace. The goal of this project is to find innovative ways for spiritual coaches to increase the effectiveness of their coaching sessions and make a tangible difference in their clients' lives.

**Goals**:

To develop a new coaching approach that integrates spiritual practices with traditional coaching techniques.
To create a system that helps spiritual coaches measure the impact of their coaching sessions.
To increase the number of people who seek out spiritual coaching by 20% in 90 days.
**Stakes**:

If the project is not completed successfully, the reputation of spiritual coaches may be impacted and the demand for their services may decline.
Failure to meet the goals may result in a loss of business for spiritual coaches and a decline in the coaching industry as a whole.
**Reserves**:

A budget of $50 to be used for research and development.
Access to a team of experts in the field of coaching and spirituality.
Access to the latest technology and tools for remote collaboration.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for spiritual coaches worldwide. The team is expected to work remotely from their PCs at home and must maintain regular communication with each other and the team leader. The project will be considered a success if all of the goals are met within the specified 90-day timeline.

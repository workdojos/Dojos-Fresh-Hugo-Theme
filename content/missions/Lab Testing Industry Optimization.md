# Mission // #Lab Testing Industry Optimization

**Project Brief**: Lab Testing Industry Optimization

**Team Leader**: Franz

**Assignment**:
The laboratory testing industry has seen significant growth in recent years, but the manual process of testing and data collection is still hindering productivity and accuracy. The team of lab techs will work together remotely for 90 days to implement a new digital solution for data collection and analysis.

**Goals**:

Improve the accuracy and efficiency of lab testing processes by reducing manual data entry.
Streamline data collection and analysis to reduce errors and improve reporting capabilities.
Enhance the overall user experience for lab techs and clients by providing a more intuitive and effective data collection and analysis solution.
**Stakes**:

Failure to deliver a high-quality solution will harm the reputation of the laboratory testing industry, leading to a loss of business and credibility.
The industry is becoming more competitive, and failure to innovate will result in a loss of market share to competitors.
Slow and manual data collection processes are becoming increasingly unacceptable to clients, and failure to address this issue could result in the loss of clients.
**Reserves**:

The team will have access to a budget of $100 for software development and hardware costs.
Technical experts will be available to provide support and training as needed.
The team will have access to a user-testing group to validate the solution before implementation.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for lab techs worldwide. Join the team and help drive change in the laboratory testing industry.

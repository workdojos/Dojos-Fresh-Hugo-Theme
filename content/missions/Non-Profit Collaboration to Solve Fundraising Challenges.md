# Mission // #Non-Profit Collaboration to Solve Fundraising Challenges

**Project Brief**: Non-Profit Collaboration to Solve Fundraising Challenges

**Team Leader**: Bahar

**Assignment**: A team of non-profit organizations will work together remotely over 90 days to solve fundraising challenges facing the non-profit industry.

**Goals**:

Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of fundraising efforts for all participating organizations.
Create a shared resource pool for non-profits to access for fundraising strategies and techniques.
Enhance collaboration and communication between non-profits to increase overall impact in the community.
**Stakes**: The non-profit industry is facing significant challenges in securing funding and resources to continue their important work. If this project is not successful, participating organizations may face reduced funding and increased competition for resources.

**Reserves**: Each participating organization will provide resources in the form of time, expertise, and data to contribute to the project. The team will also have access to external resources and tools to aid in their efforts.

Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for non-profits worldwide. Join us in this exciting opportunity to make a real-world impact on the non-profit industry.

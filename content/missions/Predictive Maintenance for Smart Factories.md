# Mission // #Predictive Maintenance for Smart Factories

**Project Brief**: Predictive Maintenance for Smart Factories

**Team Leader**: Eva

**Assignment**:
To develop a predictive maintenance solution for smart factories, which will reduce the downtime and increase the productivity of the factories. The solution should be able to predict the failures of the machines in advance, which will allow the maintenance team to fix the machines before they actually break down.

**Goals**:

To predict the failures of the machines in the smart factories with a minimum accuracy of 80%.
To reduce the downtime of the factories by 30% with the help of the predictive maintenance solution.
To increase the productivity of the factories by 15% with the help of the predictive maintenance solution.
To improve the efficiency of the maintenance team by reducing the time taken for machine maintenance by 25%.
**Stakes**:

The reputation of the data science industry will be at stake if the predictive maintenance solution fails to deliver the desired results.
The stakeholders of the smart factories will be impacted negatively if the downtime and the cost of maintenance increase.
The credibility of the data scientists on the team will be at stake if they fail to deliver a working solution within the given timeframe.
**Reserves**:

Access to real-world data from smart factories to train and validate the predictive maintenance solution.
Access to the latest machine learning algorithms and tools to develop the solution.
Access to the expertise and support of the data science community in case of any technical difficulties.
Successful completion of the project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for data scientists worldwide.

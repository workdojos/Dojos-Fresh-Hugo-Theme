# Mission // #Predictive Maintenance for Smart Factories

**Project Brief**: Predictive Maintenance for Smart Factories

**Team Leader**: Eva

**Assignment**:
To develop a predictive maintenance solution for smart factories, which will reduce the downtime and increase the productivity of the factories. The solution should be able to predict the failures of the machines in advance, which will allow the maintenance team to fix the machines before they actually break down.

**Goals**:

To predict the failures of the machines in the smart factories with a minimum accuracy of 80%.
To reduce the downtime of the factories by 30% with the help of the predictive maintenance solution.

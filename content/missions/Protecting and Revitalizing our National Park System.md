# Mission // #Protecting and Revitalizing our National Park System

**Project Brief**:
Title: Protecting and Revitalizing our National Park System

**Team Leader**: Seth

**Assignment**: The National Park System is facing numerous challenges that are impacting its health and beauty, including invasive species, deforestation, and litter. The park rangers are being tasked with finding solutions to these challenges and implementing them within 90 days. The team will work remotely from their PCs at home.

**Goals**:

Identify the most pressing challenges facing the National Park System.
Develop a comprehensive plan to address the challenges, including strategies for eradicating invasive species, reforestation, and reducing litter.
Implement the plan, working with local organizations and volunteers to ensure its success.
Monitor progress and assess the effectiveness of the strategies implemented.
**Stakes**:
The National Park System is an important part of our country's natural and cultural heritage, and its health and beauty must be protected for future generations. If the park rangers fail to address the challenges facing the National Park System, it may become damaged beyond repair.

**Reserves**:

The team will have access to all relevant resources and data, including scientific studies and data from park rangers in the field.
The team will receive support from park administrators, who will help identify potential partners and volunteers for the project.
The team will be provided with a budget to cover any necessary expenses, such as equipment or supplies.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for park rangers worldwide. This project is an opportunity for park rangers to demonstrate their leadership and creativity in addressing a critical issue facing our National Park System.

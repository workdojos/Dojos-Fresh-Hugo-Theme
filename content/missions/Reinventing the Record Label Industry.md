# Mission // #Reinventing the Record Label Industry

**Project Brief**: "Reinventing the Record Label Industry"

**Team Leader**: Rina

**Assignment**:
The record label industry has long been dominated by a few big players, stifling the growth and creativity of independent and emerging artists. In the era of digital streaming, this has only become more pronounced, with the majority of the industry's profits going to these big corporations. Our team of musical artists will work to develop a new, more equitable model for the record label industry, one that prioritizes the interests of the artists themselves.

**Goals**:

Research the current state of the record label industry, including the challenges faced by independent and emerging artists.
Identify best practices from other industries that can be applied to the record label industry.
Develop a new, more equitable model for the record label industry that prioritizes the interests of the artists.
Present the new model to key stakeholders in the industry and solicit feedback.
Refine the model based on feedback and prepare a comprehensive plan for implementation.
**Stakes**:
The success of this project has real-world consequences for the entire musical community. If our team is successful, we will have created a more equitable and supportive environment for independent and emerging artists, helping them to grow and reach their full potential. However, if we fail, the current state of the industry will remain unchanged, leaving many talented artists with limited opportunities to succeed.

**Reserves**:
To support our work, we have access to a variety of resources, including research databases, industry experts, and technology platforms. Additionally, each team member will bring their unique skills and perspectives to the table, allowing us to tackle the challenge from multiple angles.

Successful completion grants all contributing members XP and unlocks a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for musical artists worldwide.

# Mission // #Remote Botanical Project

**Project Brief**: Remote Botanical Project

**Team Leader**: Elizabeth

**Assignment**:
The botany industry is facing a critical problem with the rise of invasive species that threaten to destroy native habitats and disrupt ecosystems. The team of botanists will work remotely from their PC's at home to develop a solution that will help control the spread of invasive species and preserve the health of our ecosystems.

**Goals**:

Identify the most common invasive species in the botany industry and their methods of spread.
Develop a cost-effective and sustainable solution for controlling the spread of these invasive species.
Implement the solution in selected test sites and monitor its effectiveness.
Create a comprehensive guide for other botanists and stakeholders to follow and replicate the solution in their own communities.
**Stakes**:
The consequences of not controlling the spread of invasive species are severe and long-lasting. It could lead to the loss of native habitats and the extinction of many species. This could have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem, leading to an imbalance in the food chain and the loss of biodiversity. In addition, the economic impact of invasive species can be substantial, as they can reduce the value of crops and disrupt important industries such as fishing and forestry.

**Reserves**:

The team will have access to a research database that contains information on invasive species and their methods of spread.
Each member will receive a budget to purchase the necessary materials to implement their solution.
The team will have access to remote monitoring and testing equipment to monitor the effectiveness of their solution.
**Successful Completion**:
If the team successfully completes the project within 90 days, they will be granted XP and will unlock a new challenge in their quest to revolutionize the workplace for botanists worldwide. This project will serve as a model for future botanical projects and will demonstrate the effectiveness of remote collaboration in solving complex botanical problems.

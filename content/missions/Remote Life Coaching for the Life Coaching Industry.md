# Mission // #Remote Life Coaching for the Life Coaching Industry

**Project Brief**: Remote Life Coaching for the Life Coaching Industry

**Team Leader**: Destiny

**Assignment**:
To create a remote life coaching program for the life coaching industry that has real-world consequences and helps to solve common challenges faced by life coaches.

**Goals**:

Develop a remote life coaching program that utilizes modern technology and best practices to deliver a high-quality life coaching experience.
Increase access to life coaching services for individuals in remote locations, who may not have access to traditional in-person life coaching services.
Increase the reach and impact of life coaches, allowing them to serve more clients and achieve better outcomes.
Empower life coaches with the skills and resources they need to effectively coach their clients remotely.
**Stakes**:

Failure to deliver a high-quality remote life coaching program could harm the reputation of the life coaching industry, and result in decreased demand for life coaching services.
If the remote life coaching program does not effectively meet the needs of clients, this could result in negative feedback and reviews, further damaging the reputation of the life coaching industry.
If the remote life coaching program is not successful, life coaches may miss out on potential clients and opportunities to grow their businesses.
**Reserves**:

Access to a team of experts in the fields of life coaching, technology, and remote work.
A budget of $100 to be used for research, development, and marketing of the remote life coaching program.
90 days to complete the project, with regular check-ins and progress updates from the team leader, Destiny.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for life coaches worldwide.\

To ensure that remote researchers have access to the same resources and tools as their in-office counterparts.
To reduce the cost and time associated with commuting to and from work.
To promote a more flexible and environmentally-friendly work environment.
**Stakes**:

The success of this project will have a significant impact on the R&D industry and its ability to compete in a rapidly-changing global marketplace.
The R&D industry is facing increasing pressure from clients and investors to reduce costs and increase efficiency, making the successful completion of this project more important than ever.
The success of this project will also have an impact on the quality of life of remote researchers and their families, as well as on the environment.
**Reserves**:

A budget of $100 has been allocated for the project.
The team will have access to all necessary software, tools, and equipment to complete the project.
Selma will lead the project and manage the team, but all members will be expected to contribute their expertise and ideas to the project.

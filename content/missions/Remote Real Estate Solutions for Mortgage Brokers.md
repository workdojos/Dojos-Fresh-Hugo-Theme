To develop a cloud-based platform for mortgage brokers to access real estate data and tools from anywhere.
To streamline the mortgage application process for both brokers and clients by digitizing paperwork and automating parts of the process.
To provide real-time market analysis and insights to mortgage brokers so they can make informed decisions.
**Stakes**:

Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of mortgage brokers will result in a better experience for clients and improved business outcomes.
This project will position our company as a leader in the real estate industry and increase our competitiveness in the marketplace.
Failure to deliver a high-quality solution in 90 days may result in lost opportunities and decreased credibility.

Dedicated team members with experience in real estate, software development, and project management.
Access to real estate data and tools.
Adequate funding to cover development and hosting costs.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for mortgage brokers worldwide.

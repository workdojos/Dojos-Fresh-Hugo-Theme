# Mission // #Remote Space Debris Mitigation and Removal

**Project Brief**:
Project Title: Remote Space Debris Mitigation and Removal

**Team Leader**: Yuri

**Assignment**:
The assignment is to develop a solution for the increasing issue of space debris in low Earth orbit. The team will work remotely from their home PCs to create a plan for mitigating and removing space debris. The team will have 90 days to complete the project.

**Goals**:

Develop a plan for mitigating the creation of new space debris.
Create a system for identifying and tracking existing space debris.
Develop a method for removing existing space debris.
Stakes:
Space debris is a growing concern for the space industry, as it poses a threat to active satellites, space missions, and even the International Space Station. The failure to address this issue could result in costly damages and even the loss of human life. The successful completion of this project will demonstrate the capability of remote collaboration and help set the standard for future space debris management efforts.

**Reserves**:

The team will have access to current space debris tracking and mitigation data from various sources.
The team will be able to communicate and collaborate through a shared platform.
The team will have access to a budget for research and development.
Successful completion of the project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in the ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for cosmonauts worldwide. The project will serve as a stepping stone for future efforts to address space debris and ensure the safety of all space missions.

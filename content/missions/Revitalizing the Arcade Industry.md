# Mission // #Revitalizing the Arcade Industry

**Project Brief**:

Project Title: "Revitalizing the Arcade Industry"

**Team Leader**: Max

**Assignment**:
The arcade industry has been struggling in recent years due to the rise of online and mobile gaming. The team of arcade owners is tasked with finding a solution to this problem and reviving the arcade industry in 90 days working remotely from their PCs at home.

**Goals**:

Increase revenue and foot traffic to arcades.
Foster a sense of community among arcade-goers.
Create a unique and enjoyable experience that cannot be found in online or mobile gaming.
**Stakes**:
The success or failure of this project will determine the future of the arcade industry. If the team is successful in revitalizing the arcade, they will not only secure their own livelihoods but also create job opportunities for others in the industry. On the other hand, if the team fails, the arcade industry could disappear altogether.

**Reserves**:

Access to market research and data analysis tools
Collaboration tools for remote work
A budget for marketing and promotions
Access to industry experts for consultation and advice
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in the ultimate quest to revolutionize gaming worldwide. This project is a crucial step in ensuring the longevity of the arcade industry and preserving its place in the gaming world.

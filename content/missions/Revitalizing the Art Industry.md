# Mission // #Revitalizing the Art Industry

**Project Brief**: Revitalizing the Art Industry
**Team Leader**: Olivia

**Assignment**:
The art industry is facing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn. The gallery owners need to come up with innovative solutions to keep their businesses afloat and bring the industry back to its glory days.

**Goals**:

To increase the online presence of the art galleries by developing an interactive virtual platform to showcase the artworks.
To increase sales by implementing new marketing strategies and reaching new customers through social media and digital advertising.
To foster collaboration among the galleries and the artists by creating a network to share resources, ideas, and opportunities.
**Stakes**:
If the project is not completed successfully, the galleries might face closure, and the art industry will continue to decline, leaving artists and employees without a source of livelihood.

**Reserves**:

All team members will have access to online tools and resources to support their work remotely.
The team leader will provide weekly check-ins and provide guidance and support when needed.
A budget of $50 will be allocated for the project to cover the costs of marketing, software, and technical support.
Successful completion of the project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for art gallery owners worldwide.

# Mission // #Revolutionizing the Travel Industry for Backpackers

**Project Brief**: Revolutionizing the Travel Industry for Backpackers

**Team Leader**: Becca

**Assignment**: The travel industry has been greatly impacted by the pandemic, and backpackers are facing numerous challenges in their travels. Our team's goal is to create a solution that will help make traveling easier and more affordable for backpackers.

**Goals**:

Develop an online platform that connects backpackers with local hosts for affordable accommodation options.
Create a virtual currency system that allows backpackers to exchange goods and services with local communities.
Offer a range of travel insurance options that cater to the specific needs of backpackers.
Develop a mobile app that provides real-time information on local events, activities, and cultural experiences.
Establish partnerships with local organizations and businesses to support sustainable tourism and benefit local communities.
**Stakes**: The successful completion of this project will have a significant impact on the travel industry and will help to restore the confidence of backpackers in traveling. In addition, the project will provide a much-needed solution to the current challenges faced by backpackers and will benefit both local communities and the environment.

**Reserves**: The team will have 90 days to complete the project, and all members will be working remotely from their PC's at home. To ensure successful completion, the team will need to collaborate effectively and utilize their individual strengths to achieve the goals set out in the project brief.

Successful completion of the project will grant all contributing members XP and will unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the freelance market for travelers worldwide.

# Mission // #Solve Police Corruption in 90 Days

**Project Brief**:
**Team Leader**: Shelly
**Assignment**: Solve Police Corruption in 90 Days

**Goals**:

Identify corrupt police officers within the department.
Gather evidence of their wrongdoings.
Report the findings to the relevant authorities.
Implement new measures to prevent future corruption.
**Stakes**:

If the team is unable to identify and report any corrupt officers, the public's trust in the police will continue to decrease.
If the team is unable to implement new measures to prevent corruption, it will be more difficult to regain public trust.
The department will continue to be tarnished by the reputation of corrupt officers.
**Reserves**:

Access to all police records and evidence
Additional resources and support from internal affairs
Financial compensation for any overtime work required
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for police officers worldwide.

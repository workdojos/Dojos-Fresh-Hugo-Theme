# Mission // #The Digital Marketing Crisis

**Project Brief**: The Digital Marketing Crisis

**Assignment**: The digital marketing industry is facing a critical challenge as the number of scams and fraudulent activities has skyrocketed in recent months. Jaxon, the team leader, is assembling a team of web jedis to solve this puzzle and restore credibility.

**Goals**:

To identify and eliminate all forms of scams and fraudulent activities within the digital marketing industry.
To establish new security protocols and measures to prevent similar activities from taking place in the future.
To educate digital marketing professionals on how to identify and avoid scams and fraudulent activities.
To restore the credibility of the digital marketing services industry.
**Stakes**: The digital marketing industry is facing a crisis of trust as clients are becoming increasingly wary of scams and fraudulent activities. If the puzzle is not solved, the digital marketing industry will continue to decline, leading to a decline in revenue and the loss of many jobs.

**Reserves**: The team will be working remotely from their PCs at home and will have access to the following resources:

A comprehensive database of scams and fraudulent activities within the digital marketing industry.
A secure platform to communicate and collaborate with each other.
Access to industry experts and professionals who will provide support and guidance.

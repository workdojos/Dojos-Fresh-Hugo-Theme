# Mission // #The Future of Sustainable Design

**Project Brief**: The Future of Sustainable Design

**Team Leader**: Petra

**Assignment**:
Design a sustainable packaging solution for a leading cosmetic brand that will minimize waste, reduce energy consumption, and demonstrate a commitment to environmentally responsible practices. The packaging must be visually appealing, cost-effective, and easy to produce on a large scale.

**Goals**:

To reduce the carbon footprint of the cosmetic brand's packaging process by 30%.
To increase consumer awareness of the environmental impact of packaging and encourage sustainable choices.
To set a new standard for sustainable packaging in the cosmetic industry and inspire other companies to follow suit.
**Stakes**:

Failure to meet the goals could result in negative publicity for the brand and decreased consumer confidence.
Poorly designed packaging could result in production difficulties and higher costs, which could harm the brand's profitability.
The project must be completed within 90 days in order to meet production deadlines and stay ahead of competitors.
**Reserves**:

The team must work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but regular virtual meetings will be scheduled to ensure progress and collaboration.
The team will have access to industry experts, research databases, and cutting-edge technologies to support their work.
A budget of $50 has been allocated for materials, equipment, and other resources necessary to complete the project.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for graphic designers worldwide.

**Project Brief**: The Impact of Climate Change on the Outdoor Adventure Industry

**Team Leader**: Blythe

**Assignment**:
The outdoor adventure industry is facing major challenges as a result of climate change, including the melting of glaciers and changing weather patterns. The team is tasked with finding a solution to the impacts of climate change on the outdoor adventure industry and developing a plan to mitigate these impacts.

**Goals**:

Develop a plan to mitigate the impacts of climate change on the outdoor adventure industry
Implement the plan in the most effective and efficient manner possible
**Stakes**:
The outdoor adventure industry is a major contributor to the global economy, and its continued success is crucial for the livelihoods of millions of people. If the impacts of climate change are not addressed, it could result in significant losses for the industry and those who depend on it.

**Reserves**:
The team will have access to a budget of $100 to fund any necessary research, travel, and implementation costs. Additionally, the team will have access to a network of experts in the fields of climate science, adventure tourism, and sustainable business practices.

Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in the ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for adventurers worldwide. This project is just the beginning of our mission to create a sustainable and thriving outdoor adventure industry for generations to come.

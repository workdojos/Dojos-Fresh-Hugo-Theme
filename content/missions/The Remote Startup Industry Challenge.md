# Mission // #The Remote Startup Industry Challenge

**Project Brief**: The Remote Startup Industry Challenge

**Team Leader**: Pedro

**Assignment**: To develop a solution to the challenges faced by the startup industry while working remotely from their PC's at home.

**Goals**:

To improve the productivity of remote startup teams.
To enhance communication and collaboration between team members.
To provide a secure and convenient platform for remote work.
**Stakes**:

The success of the startup industry depends on the ability to work efficiently while remote.
The competition between startups is growing, and a lack of a reliable remote solution will put startups at a disadvantage.
Startups that fail to adapt to the changing landscape of remote work risk losing their market share and funding opportunities.
**Reserves**:

Time: 90 days to complete the project.
Budget: The team will be provided with a budget of $50 to invest in technology and other resources to achieve their goals.
Expertise: The team will have access to expert mentors and advisors in the startup industry to guide their progress.
Successful completion of the project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for cofounders worldwide. The solution developed will not only benefit the startup industry, but also serve as a model for other industries looking to improve their remote work processes.

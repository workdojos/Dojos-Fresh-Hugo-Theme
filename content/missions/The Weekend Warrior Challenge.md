# Mission // #The Weekend Warrior Challenge

**Project Brief**: "The Weekend Warrior Challenge: Freelance Industry Puzzle"

**Assignment**:
The freelance industry is facing a major challenge. A new company has entered the market, offering freelancers low prices for their services. This is causing a negative impact on the industry, with many freelancers unable to make a living wage. The weekend warriors have been tasked with solving this problem and coming up with a solution that will benefit both freelancers and clients.

**Goals**:

Research the impact that the new company is having on the freelance industry.
Analyze the current market trends and identify potential solutions.
Develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the issue and provides a solution that benefits both freelancers and clients.
Present the plan to industry leaders and gain their support.
**Stakes**:
The stakes are high for the freelance industry. If a solution is not found, many freelancers will be forced to leave the industry and find other sources of income. This will result in a significant loss of talent and creativity, which will harm the entire industry.

**Reserves**:
The weekend warriors will have access to a variety of resources to help them in their research and problem-solving efforts. They will have access to industry reports, data and statistics, and will be able to network with industry leaders and other freelancers.

Successful completion of this puzzle will result in a positive impact on the freelance industry and will provide all contributing members with XP. It will also unlock a new challenge in the ultimate quest to revolutionize the Weekend Worker industry.

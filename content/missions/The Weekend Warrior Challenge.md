**Project Brief**: "The Weekend Warrior Challenge: Freelance Industry Puzzle"

**Assignment**:
The freelance industry is facing a major challenge. A new company has entered the market, offering freelancers low prices for their services. This is causing a negative impact on the industry, with many freelancers unable to make a living wage. The weekend warriors have been tasked with solving this problem and coming up with a solution that will benefit both freelancers and clients.

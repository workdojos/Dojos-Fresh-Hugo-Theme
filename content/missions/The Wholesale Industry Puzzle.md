# Mission // #The Wholesale Industry Puzzle

**Project Brief**:

**Assignment**: The Wholesale Industry Puzzle

**Team Leader**: Frans

**Goals**:

To increase the overall efficiency of the wholesale industry by reducing the cost of production and distribution of goods.
To improve the accuracy of inventory management to ensure that products are always in stock and readily available for customers.
To enhance the customer experience by reducing the time it takes to receive orders and increasing the quality of customer service.
**Stakes**: The wholesale industry is a critical component of the global economy, and its success or failure has far-reaching consequences. The stakes are high, as the industry provides essential goods and services to countless businesses and individuals. If the industry is not able to keep up with the rapidly changing demands of the market, it could face serious consequences, including reduced profits, increased competition, and a decline in customer trust.

**Reserves**: The team of wholesalers has one month to complete the puzzle and must work remotely from their PCs at home. The team will have access to all relevant data and resources, including market trends, industry reports, and customer feedback. In addition, the team can call upon a network of experts and advisors for guidance and support as needed.

Successful completion of the puzzle grants all contributing members XP and unlocks a new challenge in the ultimate quest to revolutionize the Wholesale industry. The team must work together to overcome obstacles and find innovative solutions to the challenges facing the industry. With the right strategy, determination, and collaboration, the team can succeed in revolutionizing the wholesale industry and securing its future for generations to come.

# Mission // #Uncovering Corporate Espionage

**Project Brief**: Uncovering Corporate Espionage

**Team Leader**: Harold

**Assignment**: A prominent tech company has recently reported a significant loss of sensitive information and believes that an inside job may be to blame. The company has hired our team of investigators to uncover the truth and bring the responsible parties to justice.

**Goals**:

Identify the source of the breach and gather evidence to support the findings.
Retrieve any stolen information and secure it in a secure location.
Recommend changes to the companyâ€™s security measures to prevent future breaches.
**Stakes**:

If the responsible parties are not uncovered, the company risks losing their reputation and future business.
If the stolen information falls into the wrong hands, it could result in significant financial and legal consequences for the company and its clients.
Failure to secure the stolen information and make necessary changes to prevent future breaches could result in a lawsuit against our team.
**Reserves**:

The team will have access to all necessary resources to complete the assignment, including technology and equipment.
All findings and recommendations will be presented to the company in a confidential report.
The team will work remotely, communicating regularly with Harold and the company.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for investigators worldwide.

# Mission // #Virtual Physical Therapy Platform

**Project Brief**:
Title: Virtual Physical Therapy Platform
**Team Leader**: Adia
**Assignment**: To create a virtual physical therapy platform for patients that is accessible from their homes and can be supervised by physical therapists in real-time.

**Goals**:

To create a user-friendly platform that is accessible from any device with an internet connection.
To provide a virtual space for patients to interact with physical therapists and receive real-time guidance and feedback.
To increase access to physical therapy for patients who are unable to visit a physical therapist in person.
To improve patient outcomes by providing more frequent and consistent physical therapy sessions.
**Stakes**:

The physical therapy industry is facing a significant challenge as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many patients unable to visit physical therapists in person.
If the virtual physical therapy platform is not created and implemented successfully, patients will continue to face difficulties accessing physical therapy and may not receive the care they need to recover from their injuries or conditions.
The success of this project has the potential to revolutionize the physical therapy industry and increase access to physical therapy for patients worldwide.
**Reserves**:

The team will have 90 days to complete the project and deliver a functional virtual physical therapy platform.
All team members will work remotely from their PC's at home.
Adia will serve as the project leader and coordinate the efforts of the team.
The team will have access to all necessary resources, including software, hardware, and support from technical experts.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for physical therapists worldwide.

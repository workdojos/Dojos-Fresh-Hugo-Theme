# Mission // #Virtual Reality Training and Safety Standards

**Project Brief**: Virtual Reality Training and Safety Standards

**Team Leader**: Ivana

**Assignment**:
Develop a comprehensive virtual reality training and safety program that sets standards for VR training in the workplace. This program should address the physical and mental health concerns of VR users, as well as ensure that the training environment is safe and efficient.

**Goals**:

Establish a set of VR training standards that prioritize user safety and health.
Design VR training scenarios that simulate real-world scenarios and challenges in a safe and controlled environment.
Provide comprehensive support and guidance for VR training users, including recommendations for proper use, set up, and maintenance.
Develop tools and resources for tracking and monitoring user engagement, performance, and progress in VR training.
**Stakes**:

The VR industry is rapidly growing and expanding, and VR training has the potential to revolutionize the way people learn and develop new skills. However, without proper standards and guidelines, VR training can pose a risk to users' health and safety.
Failure to establish VR training and safety standards could result in increased reports of health problems and accidents among VR users, potentially leading to increased regulation and restrictions on VR training and usage.
A successful VR training and safety program will position your team as leaders in the VR industry and increase your visibility and credibility among potential clients and collaborators.
**Reserves**:

The team will have 90 days to complete the project and deliver a comprehensive VR training and safety program.
The team will be working remotely and will have access to the latest VR technology, software, and tools.
The team will have access to research and data on VR training and safety, as well as the support and guidance of industry experts and stakeholders.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for developers worldwide.

# Mission // #Wine Industry Puzzle Challenge

**Project Brief**: Wine Industry Puzzle Challenge

**Team Leader**: Jacques

**Assignment**:
The wine industry is facing a major crisis as a new species of grapevine pest has been discovered and is rapidly spreading throughout vineyards, causing widespread damage and reducing yields. The pest is resistant to all known insecticides and fungicides, and there is no cure or solution in sight.

**Goals**:
The main goal of this puzzle challenge is to find a way to stop the spread of the grapevine pest and develop a solution to prevent further damage to the vineyards.

**Stakes**:
The stakes are high as the spread of this pest could have serious consequences for the wine industry, leading to a reduction in wine production, loss of revenue, and potential job losses. In addition, the crisis could also have a major impact on the global economy as wine is a major export commodity.

**Reserves**:
A dedicated research team has been working on the problem for several months, and has made significant progress in understanding the biology and behavior of the pest. However, they are still in the early stages of developing a solution and need help from the wine enthusiast community to bring their work to fruition.

The team will have access to the latest research data and state-of-the-art technology to analyze and interpret the data, as well as a wealth of information from the wine industry. The team will also have access to a database of experts in the field, who can provide guidance and support as needed.

Successful completion of the puzzle challenge will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in the ultimate quest to revolutionize the wine industry. So, if you are a wine enthusiast who is passionate about solving complex problems, this is your chance to make a real difference in the world. Join us today and help save the wine industry!

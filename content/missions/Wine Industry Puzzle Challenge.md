**Project Brief**: Wine Industry Puzzle Challenge

**Assignment**:
The wine industry is facing a major crisis as a new species of grapevine pest has been discovered and is rapidly spreading throughout vineyards, causing widespread damage and reducing yields. The pest is resistant to all known insecticides and fungicides, and there is no cure or solution in sight.

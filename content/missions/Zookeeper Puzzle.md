# Mission // #Zookeeper Puzzle

**Project Brief**: Zookeeper Puzzle

**Team Leader**: Anna

**Assignment**:
A new virus has broken out in the zoo, infecting the animals and causing them to become aggressive and dangerous. The virus is spreading rapidly and the zookeepers must work together to find a cure before it’s too late.

**Goals**:

Identify the cause of the virus and determine the best course of action to cure it.
Work together to gather all the information necessary to develop a cure.
Communicate effectively and efficiently with each other to solve the puzzle as quickly as possible.
**Stakes**:

The lives of all the animals in the zoo are at risk.
If the virus is not stopped, it could potentially spread to other zoos and wildlife sanctuaries.
The reputation of the zoo and the zookeeper team is on the line. If they fail to solve the puzzle, the zoo will be closed permanently.
**Reserves**:

Each team member has access to all the necessary research materials and databases.
The team leader, Anna, will provide regular updates on the progress of the puzzle and answer any questions that arise.
If a team member becomes stuck or needs assistance, they can reach out to their colleagues for help.
Note: The zookeeper team has exactly one week to solve the puzzle before the consequences become dire.

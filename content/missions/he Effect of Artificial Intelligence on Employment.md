# Mission // #The Effect of Artificial Intelligence on Employment

**Project Brief**:

**Team Leader**: Dr. Marika Smith

**Assignment**: The Effect of Artificial Intelligence on Employment

**Goals**:

To examine the impact of AI on the employment market in the next 5-10 years.
To identify the industries that are most likely to be affected by AI.
To determine the skills that will be in high demand as AI takes over certain jobs.
To recommend strategies for individuals and organizations to adapt to the changes in the employment market caused by AI.
**Stakes**:

With the increasing use of AI, many jobs are expected to become automated, leading to large-scale unemployment.
The lack of understanding of the impact of AI on employment can lead to a significant decrease in productivity and economic growth.
It is crucial for economists to understand the impact of AI on the employment market so that they can provide recommendations to mitigate its effects.
**Reserves**:

Data on the current and projected use of AI in various industries.
Studies on the impact of AI on employment and the workforce.
Experts in the field of AI and employment.
A survey of individuals and organizations to understand their attitudes towards AI and employment.
**Successful Completion**:
All contributing members will receive XP and unlock a new challenge in our ultimate quest to revolutionize the workplace for economists worldwide. The results of this project will be published in leading economic journals, and the recommendations will be presented to policymakers and stakeholders in the private sector to drive change.

As a philosopher, I would first approach this question by examining the concept of ethics itself. Ethics can be defined as a system of moral principles or values that guides the behavior of a person or group. It is concerned with what is right or wrong, and how we ought to behave in different situations.

In the context of starting a career as a mortgage broker, it is important to consider the ethical implications of your actions. This includes considering how your decisions will impact others, and whether they align with your personal values.

One ethical framework that could be useful in this context is deontology, which emphasizes the importance of following certain moral duties or rules. In the case of a mortgage broker, this could include upholding principles of fairness and honesty in all interactions with clients.

Another ethical framework that could be useful is consequentialism, which focuses on the consequences of actions rather than the actions themselves. This could involve considering the long-term impacts of your decisions on the community or society at large.

Ultimately, the ethical framework that you choose will depend on your personal values and beliefs. It is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of your actions and to make sure that they align with your moral code.

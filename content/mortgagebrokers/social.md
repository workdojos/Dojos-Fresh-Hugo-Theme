Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are some ideas for creating an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest to promote your new business as a mortgage broker in the real estate industry:

Instagram: Create visually appealing posts featuring stunning homes and properties that showcase the types of properties you can help clients secure mortgages for. Use hashtags related to real estate, mortgage brokering, and home ownership to attract the right audience. Make sure to include a call to action in each post, such as "DM me for more information" or "Contact me to start the mortgage process."

Twitter: Tweet out industry news and updates related to real estate and mortgage brokering, and share any personal experiences or success stories from your clients. Use hashtags and engage with other users in the industry to build your following.

YouTube: Create a YouTube channel featuring educational videos on the mortgage process, including tips for first-time home buyers and strategies for securing the best mortgage rates. Engage with viewers by asking for their questions and concerns and addressing them in future videos.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring beautiful homes and properties, as well as infographics and other visual content related to the mortgage process and home ownership. Use relevant keywords and hashtags to make sure your content is discoverable.

Overall, the key is to create valuable, informative content that will be useful to your target audience and encourage them to engage with your business. Good luck with your new venture!

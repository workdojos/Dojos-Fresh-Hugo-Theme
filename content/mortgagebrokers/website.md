As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons. First, open-source technology is generally free to use, which can save your business significant costs compared to purchasing proprietary software. Additionally, open-source technology is often more customizable than proprietary software, which allows you to tailor your website to better meet your business goals and the needs of your users.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that can be used to create a professional website for your mortgage brokerage business. Some of the leading options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which are all content management systems (CMS) that allow you to easily build and manage your website without requiring any coding knowledge. Other options include static-site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo, which are useful for creating websites that are faster and more secure than traditional CMS platforms.

One potential downside of using open-source technology is that you may need to invest more time and resources into learning how to use it effectively. However, there are many online resources and communities available that can help you get up to speed quickly. Additionally, you may need to invest in hosting and server costs if you choose to host your website on your own server, rather than using a cloud-based hosting service.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your own website far outweigh the potential downsides. By using open-source tools, you can create a professional and customizable website that meets your business needs and provides a great user experience, all while saving money on software costs.

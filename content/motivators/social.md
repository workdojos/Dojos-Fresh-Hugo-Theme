First, I would suggest creating a cohesive theme for your campaign that is visually appealing and aligns with your brand message. This could include using consistent colors, fonts, and imagery throughout all of your social media platforms.

On Instagram, I would recommend creating visually stunning images and videos of your motivational speaking events, as well as behind-the-scenes glimpses of your work. Use hashtags and engage with related accounts in order to reach a larger audience.

On Twitter, I would suggest tweeting out motivational quotes and messages, as well as sharing updates about your upcoming events and speaking engagements. Use Twitter's platform to connect with other motivational speakers and industry professionals, as well as engage with your followers through polls, questions, and other interactive content.

On YouTube, I would recommend creating a channel where you can share video versions of your motivational talks, as well as vlogs about your journey as a speaker and any tips or advice you have for others looking to get into the industry.

On Pinterest, I would recommend creating boards centered around motivational themes, such as "Inspiration," "Personal Growth," and "Success." Pin images and quotes related to these themes, as well as any content from your Instagram and Twitter pages.

Throughout all of these platforms, be sure to engage with your followers and respond to comments and messages in a timely and authentic manner. This will help to build a strong and loyal following for your business.

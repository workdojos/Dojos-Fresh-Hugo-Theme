As a philosopher, the first thing I would do in developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a musical artist working in the music industry is to consider the values and principles that are most important to me as an artist. These might include things like honesty, integrity, fairness, respect, and compassion.

Next, I would consider the ethical implications of various actions I might take as a musical artist, such as creating and sharing music, collaborating with other artists, and negotiating contracts. Some questions I might consider include:

Is it ethical to use other artists' work as inspiration or to borrow elements from their music in my own compositions?
Is it ethical to accept payment for performing or sharing music without giving credit to the original creators?
Is it ethical to participate in contracts or agreements that exploit or unfairly benefit one party over the other?
To further develop my ethical framework, I might also seek out the guidance and insights of other philosophers, musicians, and industry professionals who have grappled with similar ethical dilemmas. I might also consider consulting ethical codes or guidelines developed by organizations within the music industry, such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) or the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Ultimately, my ethical framework for starting a career as a musical artist working in the music industry would be a personal and evolving set of values and principles that guide my actions and decisions as an artist. It would be informed by my own moral reasoning, as well as the input and perspectives of others, and it would aim to uphold the highest ethical standards in all of my professional endeavors.

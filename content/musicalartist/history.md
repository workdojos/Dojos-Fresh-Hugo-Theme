The word "music" has its roots in the Greek language, derived from the word "mousike," which refers to the art of the muses. In ancient Greek culture, the muses were goddesses of the arts, and "mousike" referred to any form of artistic expression, including music, poetry, and dance. The word was later adopted into Latin as "musica," and eventually evolved into the modern English word "music."

The term "musical artist" is a relatively modern invention, as the concept of a professional musician or performer did not exist in ancient cultures. In ancient Greece and Rome, music was often seen as a hobby or leisure activity, rather than a profession. The term "musical artist" likely emerged in the 18th or 19th century, as the concept of the professional musician began to emerge and the music industry began to take shape.

Over time, the meaning of the word "music" has broadened to encompass a wide range of styles and genres, including classical, rock, pop, hip hop, and electronic. The term "musical artist" now refers to anyone who creates or performs music professionally, regardless of their specific genre or style.

Sure thing! Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign to promote your new business as a musical artist:

Instagram: Create a series of posts showcasing your music, behind the scenes of your recording process, and any upcoming performances or releases. Utilize hashtags relevant to the music industry, such as #musicartist #newmusic #singersongwriter, to increase visibility and reach a larger audience.

Twitter: Use Twitter to share updates on your music, such as new releases or upcoming performances. You can also engage with other artists and industry professionals by retweeting and commenting on their posts.

YouTube: Create a YouTube channel to share your music and provide a more in-depth look into your creative process. Consider creating music videos, live performance videos, and other content that showcases your talent and connects with your audience.

Pinterest: Use Pinterest to create a board featuring your music and inspiration for your craft. You can also create boards featuring your favorite artists, music industry tips, and anything else relevant to your brand.

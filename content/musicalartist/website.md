As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons. First and foremost, open-source technology allows you to have complete control over the design and functionality of your website, as you have access to the source code and can customize it to meet your specific needs and goals. Additionally, open-source technology is typically more cost-effective compared to proprietary platforms, as you don't have to pay for licenses or subscriptions.

Some of the leading open-source web builders that can be useful for building your website include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and functionality, including content management, e-commerce capabilities, and SEO tools. They also have large developer communities, which means there is a wealth of resources and support available for customizing and optimizing your website.

Another option to consider is using a static-site generator, such as Jekyll or Hugo. These tools allow you to build a website using simple, static HTML files, which can be easily deployed on your own server. This can be a great option if you don't need a lot of dynamic functionality, but still want a professional-looking website that is fast and easy to maintain.

In terms of the pros and cons of using open-source technology, one of the main benefits is the cost savings mentioned above. However, it is important to note that you may need to invest some time and resources into learning how to use and customize these tools, as well as maintaining and updating your website. On the other hand, proprietary platforms may offer more support and resources, but may come with a higher price tag.

Ultimately, the best solution for your business will depend on your specific needs and goals. I would recommend taking the time to research and compare the various options available, and considering factors such as your budget, technical expertise, and desired functionality.

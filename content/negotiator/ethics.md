As a philosopher, I would approach the development of an ethical framework for a career as a negotiator in the international arbitration industry by first understanding the nature of the work involved. International arbitration involves resolving disputes between parties in a neutral, unbiased manner, often involving complex legal and financial issues.

In developing an ethical framework, it is important to consider the values and principles that guide the negotiator's actions and decision-making. One key value for a negotiator in the international arbitration industry may be impartiality, as it is essential for maintaining trust and credibility with all parties involved in the dispute.

Another key value for a negotiator in this field may be honesty and integrity. It is important for the negotiator to be transparent and straightforward in their communication and actions, in order to build trust and ensure that all parties feel that they are being treated fairly.

In addition to these values, it may be helpful for the negotiator to consider the ethical theories of Kantianism and Utilitarianism in making decisions. Kantianism emphasizes the idea of acting in accordance with universal moral principles, while Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing overall happiness or well-being.

In applying these ethical theories to the work of a negotiator in the international arbitration industry, it may be helpful to consider the potential consequences of different actions on all parties involved. For example, a negotiator may consider whether a proposed settlement would benefit all parties involved, or whether it may be more beneficial to prioritize the interests of one party over the others.

Ultimately, the development of an ethical framework for a career as a negotiator in the international arbitration industry will involve a combination of values, principles, and ethical theories, all of which are guided by the ultimate goal of promoting fairness, impartiality, and trust in the resolution of disputes. So, it is very important for a negotiator to have a clear and strong ethical framework to guide their actions and decision-making in this field.

Sure, I can help with that! Here are some suggestions for things that should appear in a curriculum for a negotiator:

Communication skills: As a negotiator, you'll need to be able to effectively communicate your ideas and persuade others to see your point of view. This includes being able to clearly articulate your thoughts and listen actively to others.

Conflict resolution: Negotiators often work to resolve conflicts between parties, so it's important to have a strong understanding of conflict resolution techniques and strategies.

Research and analysis: You'll need to be able to gather and analyze information related to the negotiation in order to make informed decisions.

Collaboration: Negotiators often work with a team, so it's important to be able to collaborate and work effectively with others.

Cultural sensitivity: Negotiating often involves working with people from different cultural backgrounds, so it's important to be aware of and sensitive to cultural differences.

Some helpful resources for learning more about negotiation include:

The Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School: This is a leading resource for learning about negotiation and conflict resolution, with a range of courses, workshops, and other resources available.

The International Association for Conflict Management (IACM): The IACM is a professional organization that offers resources and training for those interested in negotiation and conflict resolution.

The Negotiation Academy: This online resource offers a range of courses and resources focused on negotiation skills, including courses on specific negotiation strategies and techniques.

Some of the best companies to work for as a negotiator include:

McKinsey & Company: This global consulting firm often hires negotiators to work on projects related to strategy, operations, and organizational design.

Google: The tech giant hires negotiators to work on a range of projects, including developing partnerships and negotiating contracts.

The United Nations: The UN hires negotiators to work on a variety of issues, including peacekeeping and conflict resolution.

Here are a few tips and tricks for those interested in a career as a negotiator:

Practice your negotiation skills: The more you practice, the better you'll become at negotiating. Look for opportunities to practice your skills, whether in your personal or professional life.

Be prepared: It's important to do your research and come to the negotiation table with a clear understanding of what you want and what you're willing to compromise on.

Stay calm: It's easy to get emotionally invested in a negotiation, but it's important to stay calm and level-headed in order to make the best decisions.

Be flexible: Negotiations often involve compromise, so it's important to be open to finding creative solutions that meet the needs of all parties involved.

Here are a few questions a candidate should be able to answer in an interview for a negotiator role:

How do you approach a negotiation?

Can you give an example of a successful negotiation you've participated in?

How do you handle difficult or confrontational negotiations?

How do you stay calm under pressure in a negotiation?

How do you approach negotiations with people from different cultural backgrounds?

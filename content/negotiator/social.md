As a social media influencer, I would first conduct research on my target audience to understand their interests and preferences when it comes to negotiation and international arbitration. This will help me tailor my content to appeal to them and increase the chances of them engaging with my posts.

On Instagram, I would create visually appealing content such as infographics and videos to showcase my expertise in the field and offer valuable tips and insights on negotiation and arbitration. I would also share personal anecdotes and behind-the-scenes glimpses of my work to create a more personal connection with my followers.

On Twitter, I would share short and concise tweets with links to my blog articles or YouTube videos, and engage with my followers by asking for their thoughts and opinions on various topics related to my business. I would also use hashtags relevant to the negotiation and arbitration industry to increase my reach and attract new followers.

On YouTube, I would create educational videos on negotiation and arbitration techniques, as well as interviews with other experts in the field. I would also offer Q&A sessions for my followers to ask me any questions they may have about my business or the industry.

On Pinterest, I would create boards featuring infographics, quotes, and other visual content related to my business, and engage with my followers by re-pinning their content and leaving comments.

Overall, I would focus on creating engaging and informative content that provides value to my followers and showcases my expertise in the negotiation and arbitration industry. I would also be active on all platforms and engage with my followers regularly to build a strong online community and promote my business.``

As a web design consultant, I would recommend considering the use of open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, open-source technology allows for a more collaborative and transparent development process, as the source code is available for anyone to access and contribute to. This can lead to a stronger and more robust website as more developers are able to contribute their knowledge and expertise.

Additionally, open-source technology often comes with a strong community of developers and users who can provide support and assistance in the development process. This can be particularly beneficial for small businesses or individuals who may not have the resources to hire a dedicated web development team.

In terms of specific open-source web builders and static-site generators, some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal for content management systems, and Gatsby and Jekyll for static-site generators. These options offer a wide range of features and customization options, and can be easily deployed on your own server.

One potential downside to using open-source technology is that it may require a bit more technical knowledge and resources to set up and maintain. However, the benefits of having a collaborative and customizable website often outweigh this disadvantage.

In terms of costs, open-source technology is generally more cost-effective as it is free to use and modify. However, you may incur costs for hosting and additional customization or development needs. Overall, it is important to carefully consider your business goals and resources in order to determine the best solution for your website.

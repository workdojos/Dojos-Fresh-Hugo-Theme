Many of these individuals work tirelessly to improve their communities, but their efforts are often overlooked and undervalued. This lack of recognition can be demoralizing and can discourage individuals from continuing to volunteer their time and efforts.

To address these challenges, it is necessary to make it easier for neighborhood volunteerto find work and to pay them more for their efforts. This can be achieved through the creation of more opportunities and resources specifically designed for neighborhood volunteers. Additionally, we must work towards improving the community service industry as a whole by recognizing and valuing the contributions of these volunteers and providing them with the support and resources they need to succeed.

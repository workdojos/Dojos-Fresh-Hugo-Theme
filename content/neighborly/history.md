The word "neighborhood" is derived from the Old English word "nēahbūr," which literally means "near-dweller." This term referred to someone who lived close by and was therefore considered a neighbor. The word "volunteer" comes from the Latin "voluntarius," which means "willing" or "offering oneself." In the Middle Ages, volunteers were soldiers who fought without pay and were often motivated by religious or ideological beliefs.

The modern concept of a "neighborhood volunteer" refers to someone who willingly gives their time and resources to help improve the community in which they live. This can include participating in neighborhood clean-ups, helping with community events, or providing assistance to those in need.

Community services, on the other hand, refer to services provided by a community or government to meet the needs of its citizens. These services can include things like education, healthcare, and social services. The term "community service" has become more common in recent years, as it has become a popular way for individuals to give back to their communities and make a positive impact.

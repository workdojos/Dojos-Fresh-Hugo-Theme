As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology is typically free to use, which can be a significant cost-saving advantage for small businesses or organizations. Additionally, open-source technology is constantly being updated and improved by a community of developers, which means that it is often more reliable and secure than proprietary software.

There are several popular open-source web builders that can be used to create a professional-looking website, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a variety of features and customization options, making it easy to create a website that meets your specific needs.

Static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Gatsby, are also popular options for building websites. These tools allow you to create a website using simple templates and code, which can be easily deployed on your own server. This can be a great option for small businesses or organizations that don't need a lot of dynamic content or interactivity on their website.

There are also several popular open-source apps that can be used to enhance the user experience on your website. For example, you could use the Gravity Forms plugin to create customizable forms for user feedback or the WPForms plugin to create online surveys.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your website include cost savings, reliability, and the ability to customize and add features as needed. However, it is important to consider the potential downsides as well. For example, using open-source technology may require more technical skills or the need to hire a developer to assist with the setup and maintenance of the website. It is also important to consider the ongoing costs of hosting and maintaining the website.

In summary, open-source technology can be a great option for building a website for your business or organization, as long as you are prepared to invest the time and resources necessary to set it up and maintain it.

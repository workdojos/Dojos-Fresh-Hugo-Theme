As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few key reasons:

Cost savings: One of the major benefits of using open-source technology is that it is usually free to use. This can save your business significant costs compared to using proprietary software that requires a license fee.

Customization: Open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website. You can choose from a range of different open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other popular open-source apps to create a website that meets your specific business needs.

Support: There is often a large community of developers and users who support open-source technology. This can make it easier to find help and resources if you encounter any issues or have questions about how to use the software.

There are a few potential downsides to consider as well:

Limited support: While there is usually a large community of developers and users who support open-source technology, you may not have access to the same level of support as you would with proprietary software.

Security risks: Open-source software may be more vulnerable to security risks as it is open to anyone to access and potentially exploit. However, this risk can be mitigated by following best practices for website security and regularly updating your software.

In terms of costs, using open-source technology will likely be less expensive upfront as there are no license fees to pay. However, you may incur costs for hosting and maintenance, as well as for any additional customizations or professional support you may need.

Some popular open-source web builders and static-site generators to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, as well as static-site generators like Jekyll and Hugo. It is important to thoroughly research and compare these options to determine which one best meets your business needs and goals.

Digital nomad: The term "digital nomad" was first coined in the 1990s to describe individuals who used technology and the internet to work remotely, often while traveling or living in different locations. The word "digital" refers to the use of technology and the internet, and "nomad" refers to someone who moves from place to place. The concept of digital nomads has gained popularity in recent years, as more and more people are able to work remotely and travel while still maintaining a career.

Freelance: The word "freelance" has its roots in the Middle English word "free," meaning not bound or restricted. In the 19th century, freelance referred to soldiers who were hired by different armies or armies-for-hire. The term was later used to describe people who worked independently, rather than being employed by a specific company or organization. Today, a freelance worker is someone who works on a project-by-project basis, rather than being a permanent employee. The meaning of the word has remained relatively unchanged over time, although the types of work that freelancers do has changed significantly.

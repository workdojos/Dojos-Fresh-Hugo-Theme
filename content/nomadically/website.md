As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology for building your website for a few reasons.

First, open-source technology is often free to use and allows you to customize your website to fit your specific business needs. This is especially beneficial for a freelance digital nomad as it allows you to have complete control over your website without the need for expensive proprietary software.

Additionally, open-source technology is often constantly updated and improved by a community of developers, ensuring that your website remains up-to-date with the latest technology and features. This can be particularly beneficial for small businesses or individuals who may not have the resources to constantly update their website on their own.

Some popular open-source web builders that I recommend include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of customizable templates and features, making it easy to create a professional-looking website without the need for extensive coding knowledge.

Static-site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo are also a great option for creating a website as a digital nomad. These tools allow you to build a website using simple text files and then generate a fully-functional website from them. This can be especially useful for individuals who are constantly on the move as it allows for easy updating and changes to the website without the need for a traditional content management system.

There are also a number of open-source apps that can enhance the overall user experience of your website. For example, using a chat app such as Openfire can allow you to easily communicate with clients and customers in real-time.

Overall, using open-source technology has a number of benefits for creating a website as a digital nomad, including cost-effectiveness, customization, and access to a constantly-evolving community of developers. However, it is important to keep in mind that open-source technology may require a bit more technical knowledge and time to set up and maintain, so it may not be the best option for everyone.

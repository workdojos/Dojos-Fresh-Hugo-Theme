As a career counselor, it is my job to help you determine the best career path for you based on your skills, interests, and experience. Based on your desire to work in the non-profit industry, I would recommend that you consider pursuing a career in non-profit management or fundraising.

Non-profit management involves overseeing the operations of a non-profit organization, including budgeting, fundraising, and program development. In this role, you will need strong leadership skills, the ability to work with a team, and excellent communication skills.

Fundraising involves raising money for non-profit organizations through events, campaigns, and other initiatives. In this role, you will need strong communication skills, the ability to persuade others, and the ability to think creatively.

To pursue a career in non-profit management or fundraising, it would be beneficial to have a degree in a related field, such as business, marketing, or social work. You may also want to consider gaining experience through internships or volunteer work in the non-profit sector.

The job market for non-profit careers is generally strong, as there is a high demand for individuals with the skills and passion to work in the non-profit sector. However, competition for these roles can be fierce, so it is important to be proactive in seeking out opportunities and building your skills and experience.

I hope this information is helpful in guiding you towards the best career path for you. Please feel free to reach out to me for further guidance or support as you explore your options in the non-profit industry.

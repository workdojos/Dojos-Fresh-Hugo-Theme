<p>
The word "novelist" comes from the Latin "novellus," meaning "new." This was later adapted into the Old French "novele," which referred to a short story or tale. The English word "novelist" first appeared in the early 19th century, referring to someone who wrote novels, or long fictional narratives.

The word "writing" comes from the Old English "writan," which means "to scratch or incise." This refers to the original method of writing, which involved scratching or carving marks into a surface. The word "publishing" comes from the Latin "publicare," meaning "to make public." This refers to the act of making written works available to the public through printing or distribution.

The meanings of both of these words have remained relatively unchanged over time, with "novelist" still referring to a person who writes novels and "writing" still referring to the act of creating written works. "Publishing" has expanded to include the distribution of written works through various mediums, such as electronic publishing or self-publishing.

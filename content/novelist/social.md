First of all, congratulations on your new business as a novelist! As a social media influencer, I would suggest creating a cohesive campaign across all platforms to promote your new business and engage with your followers.

On Instagram, I would suggest posting visually appealing photos of your writing process, behind-the-scenes glimpses into your life as a novelist, and sneak peeks of your upcoming book. You can also utilize Instagram's IGTV feature to create more in-depth videos about your writing journey, or host a Q&A session with your followers. Don't forget to utilize relevant hashtags and engage with other writers and publishing industry professionals to increase your reach and visibility.

On Twitter, you can use the platform to share updates about your writing process, share your thoughts and insights on the writing and publishing industry, and engage with other writers and industry professionals. You can also use Twitter to share links to your blog, website, or other online content related to your business.

On YouTube, you can create a channel specifically for your writing business and share videos related to your writing journey, behind-the-scenes looks at your writing process, and even book trailers or other promotional videos for your upcoming book.

Finally, on Pinterest, you can create boards for your writing business and pin images and content related to your writing journey, your upcoming book, and the writing and publishing industry. You can also use Pinterest to share infographics, quotes, and other visually appealing content that relates to your business.

Overall, the key to a successful social media campaign is to be consistent and engaging, and to utilize the unique features and functions of each platform to your advantage. Good luck with your new business, and I hope these suggestions are helpful!

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons. First and foremost, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website, as you have access to the source code and can make changes or add features as needed. This is especially useful for businesses in the writing and publishing industry, as you may need to regularly update your website with new content or make changes to the layout to better showcase your work.

Additionally, using open-source technology can help to save you money in the long run, as many open-source web builders and static-site generators are free to use. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses or startups who may be working with limited budgets.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that are worth considering for your website, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms are easy to use and come with a wide range of features and plugins that can help you to create a professional and user-friendly website.

Another option to consider is using a static-site generator like Jekyll or Hugo. These tools allow you to create a website that is built with simple HTML and CSS, which can be faster and more efficient to load than more complex platforms.

There are also a number of other open-source apps that can be used to enhance the overall experience of your website, such as content management systems (CMS) like Ghost or Alfresco, and e-commerce platforms like Magento and WooCommerce.

While there are certainly benefits to using open-source technology to build your own website, it's important to also consider the potential drawbacks. For example, using open-source technology may require a bit more technical expertise and a willingness to learn, as you will be responsible for managing and maintaining the website on your own. Additionally, there may be additional costs associated with hosting your own website and using certain plugins or features.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your own website far outweigh the potential drawbacks. By taking the time to research and compare different web builders and static-site generators, you can find the best solution for your business and create a website that meets your needs and goals.

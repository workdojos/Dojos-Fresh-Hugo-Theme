Operations specialist:

The word "operations" comes from the Latin "operatio," which means "a working or activity." The word "specialist" comes from the Latin "specialis," which means "of or relating to a particular purpose or function."

The term "operations specialist" likely originated in the military or government sector, referring to a person who has specialized knowledge and skills in the planning and execution of various operations or tasks. It has since been adopted in other industries as well.

Clandestine services:

The word "clandestine" comes from the Latin "clandestinus," which means "hidden" or "secret." The word "services" comes from the Latin "servitium," which means "service" or "duty."

The term "clandestine services" likely refers to a group or organization that performs secretive or covert activities, often for the purpose of gathering intelligence or carrying out covert operations. This term is often used in reference to government agencies or organizations that engage in espionage or covert operations.

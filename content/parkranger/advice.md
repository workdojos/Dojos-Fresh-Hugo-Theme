To pursue a career as a park ranger, you should have a strong passion for the outdoors and a desire to protect and preserve natural resources. You should also possess strong communication and customer service skills, as well as physical fitness and the ability to work in varied weather conditions.

In terms of qualifications, a bachelor's degree in environmental science, biology, or a related field would be beneficial. Some park ranger positions may also require certification in areas such as first aid, search and rescue, and law enforcement.

To further increase your chances of obtaining a park ranger position, it may be beneficial to gain experience through internships or volunteering with organizations such as the National Park Service or state park systems.

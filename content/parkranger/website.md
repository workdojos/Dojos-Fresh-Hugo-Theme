As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization. You can modify the code to fit your specific needs and make changes to the website as your business grows and evolves. This can be especially useful for a park ranger working in the conservation and park management industry, as you may have specific requirements for your website that cannot be met by a pre-designed template.

Second, open-source technology is often more cost-effective compared to proprietary software. You do not have to pay for a license or ongoing subscription fees, which can add up over time. Additionally, the open-source community is often very active and helpful, providing support and resources for users to troubleshoot issues and make the most of their website.

Some popular open-source web builders include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a variety of templates and plug-ins that can be easily customized to meet your needs. Static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, are also gaining in popularity as they allow for faster website loading speeds and easier content management.

It's important to consider the pros and cons of each option before making a decision. WordPress and Joomla offer a wide range of features and are user-friendly, but may require more maintenance and updates compared to static-site generators. Static-site generators offer faster loading speeds and simpler content management, but may not be as feature-rich as WordPress or Joomla.

In terms of costs, using open-source technology is generally more cost-effective compared to proprietary software. However, you will need to factor in hosting and maintenance costs, as well as any additional plug-ins or customization you may require. It's important to carefully consider your budget and business goals when making a decision.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your website offers greater flexibility, customization, and cost-effectiveness compared to proprietary software. It's important to carefully consider your business goals and budget when deciding which option is best for your website.

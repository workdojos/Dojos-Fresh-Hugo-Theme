The word "pathologist" is derived from the Greek word "pathos," which means "suffering" or "disease." The suffix "ologist" refers to a specialist or expert in a particular field. Therefore, a pathologist is someone who is an expert in the study of disease, specifically in relation to the cause, nature, and effects of diseases on the body.

The word "pathologist" first appeared in the English language in the late 19th century and has remained largely unchanged in meaning since then. However, the role of a pathologist has evolved over time, with advances in technology and medicine allowing for more precise and accurate diagnoses of diseases.

The word "infectious" is derived from the Latin word "infectus," which means "to taint or contaminate." It refers to the ability of a disease or condition to be transmitted from one person or organism to another.

The concept of infectious diseases has been known for centuries, with ancient civilizations often attributing the spread of illness to supernatural forces or curses. However, it was not until the discovery of microorganisms and the role they play in the transmission of disease that the term "infectious diseases" was coined in the 19th century.

Since then, the understanding and treatment of infectious diseases has advanced significantly, with the development of vaccines and other methods of prevention and control. However, infectious diseases continue to be a significant global health issue, with the emergence of new and emerging diseases posing ongoing challenges.

As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few reasons.

First, open-source technology offers a wide range of options and flexibility when it comes to designing and customizing your website. There are many popular open-source web builders, static-site generators, and apps available that can be easily customized to meet your specific needs and goals. This allows you to create a website that is tailored to your business, rather than being limited to pre-designed templates or features.

Second, open-source technology is generally more cost-effective compared to proprietary solutions. Many open-source options are free to use, and the cost of customization and development is typically lower than proprietary solutions. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses or startups looking to keep costs down.

Finally, open-source technology is often more secure and stable compared to proprietary solutions. This is because the code is open for anyone to review and improve upon, which allows for better detection and resolution of potential security vulnerabilities.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can offer a wide range of benefits, including flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and security. Some of the leading open-source web builders and static-site generators include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, while some popular open-source apps include Magento for e-commerce and Moodle for online learning platforms. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option and determine which one is best suited for your business needs and goals.

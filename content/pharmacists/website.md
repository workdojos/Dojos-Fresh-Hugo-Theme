As a web design consultant, I would recommend considering the use of open-source technology to build your website for a few key reasons.

First, using open-source technology allows for a higher level of customization and flexibility when building your website. This means that you can tailor the design and functionality of your website to meet the specific needs and goals of your business as a pharmacist, rather than being limited by pre-designed templates or features.

Additionally, open-source technology often comes with a strong community of developers and users who can offer support and resources when needed. This can be particularly helpful when building a website for a niche industry such as pharmaceuticals, as you may have specific requirements or needs that may not be covered by proprietary software.

Some popular open-source web builders that may be suitable for your needs include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. Static-site generators such as Jekyll and Gatsby can also be useful for creating a website with a more streamlined, lightweight design. Other popular open-source apps that can enhance the user experience on your website include Calendly for appointment scheduling and Gravity Forms for forms and surveys.

As with any software or technology, there are pros and cons to using open-source technology to build your website. One potential con is that you may need to invest more time and resources into customizing and maintaining your website, as you will not have the support of a dedicated software company. However, the cost savings of using open-source technology can often outweigh this drawback.

In summary, using open-source technology to build your website can offer a high level of customization, a supportive community of developers, and cost savings. It is important to weigh the pros and cons and determine the best fit for your business goals and needs.

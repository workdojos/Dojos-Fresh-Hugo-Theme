First, I would conduct a social media audit to assess the current state of the organization's presence on these platforms. This would involve analyzing the current content, engagement levels, and overall aesthetic to determine what is and is not working.

Next, I would create a content calendar that aligns with the organization's goals and values. This calendar would include a mix of informative and educational content, as well as more lighthearted and engaging posts. I would also incorporate relevant hashtags and participate in Twitter chats and Instagram challenges to increase visibility and reach.

To increase traffic to the website and conversion, I would include calls to action in posts, such as "Click the link in our bio to learn more" or "Sign up for our newsletter for updates on upcoming events." I would also regularly share blog articles and resources from the website on social media to drive traffic back to the site.

To engage with the audience, I would respond to all questions and comments in a timely and professional manner, and encourage followers to share their thoughts and experiences related to philosophy and higher education. I would also monitor conversations through community management tools to stay up-to-date on any relevant discussions and participate as needed.

Finally, I would use analytics to measure the success of our campaigns and make data-driven decisions on what content and strategies are most effective. I would also be on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate with others in the philosophy and higher education industry, such as partnering on events or sharing each other's content.

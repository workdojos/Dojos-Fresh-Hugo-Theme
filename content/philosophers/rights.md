As a philosopher working in the higher education industry, I strongly believe in fair work practices for all workers. Unfortunately, there have been recent trends and events within the industry that have highlighted the need for greater protection of workerâ€™s rights and fair treatment.

One of the most concerning trends in the industry is the rise of adjunct professors, who are often paid low wages and do not receive the same benefits as full-time faculty members. This is a clear injustice, as adjunct professors often have the same education and qualifications as their full-time counterparts, yet are not given the same level of respect or compensation. This exploitation of adjunct professors not only undermines their dignity, but also hinders the quality of education that students receive, as adjunct professors may not have the same job security or resources as full-time faculty.

Additionally, there have been numerous reports of sexual harassment and discrimination within the higher education industry, particularly against women and minority groups. These issues not only harm the individuals who experience them, but also create a toxic and hostile work environment for all employees. It is imperative that universities take steps to address and prevent such behavior, and support those who have experienced it.

To promote fair work practices in the higher education industry, I believe that universities should prioritize the fair treatment and proper compensation of all faculty members, including adjunct professors. This includes offering competitive wages, benefits, and job security, as well as creating a culture of respect and inclusion for all employees. Universities should also take a proactive approach to addressing and preventing issues such as sexual harassment and discrimination.

Ultimately, fair work practices are not only a matter of justice and fairness, but also contribute to the overall success and excellence of the higher education industry. By prioritizing the rights and well-being of workers, we can create a stronger and more sustainable academic community.

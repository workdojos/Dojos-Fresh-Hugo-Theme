The word "photojournalism" is a combination of the words "photo," which is short for "photograph," and "journalism." The word "photograph" comes from the Greek words "phos," which means "light," and "graph," which means "to draw." The word "journalism" comes from the French word "journal," which means "daily," and the suffix "-ism," which denotes a practice or theory.

The word "news" comes from the Old English word "nÄ“os," which means "new" or "fresh." The word "media" comes from the Latin word "medium," which means "middle" or "means of communication."

The meaning of the word "photojournalism" has not changed much over time. It refers to the practice of using photographs to report on news events. The meaning of the word "news" has also remained largely unchanged, referring to new information or events. The meaning of the word "media" has changed slightly over time, as it originally referred to the physical means of communication, such as newspapers and radio, but now also includes digital forms of communication, such as social media.

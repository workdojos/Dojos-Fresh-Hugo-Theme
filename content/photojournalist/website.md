As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for more flexibility in terms of customization and customization options. This can be particularly useful for a photo journalist who may want to showcase their work in a unique way. Additionally, using open-source technology allows you to take advantage of a community of developers who are constantly updating and improving the technology, which can lead to better security and functionality for your website.

There are many open-source web builders and static-site generators available for you to choose from, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and customization options, and are popular choices for businesses in the journalism, news, and media industry. Other popular open-source apps that can be deployed on your own server include content management systems like Ghost and Grav, and e-commerce platforms like Magento and WooCommerce.

One of the main benefits of using open-source technology is that it is generally free to use, which can save you money on website development costs. However, there may be costs associated with hosting and maintaining your website, as well as the time and resources required to set up and manage the site. It is important to weigh the pros and cons and consider your budget and resources before making a decision.

In summary, using open-source technology to build your website can offer a wide range of customization options, take advantage of a supportive developer community, and potentially save you money on development costs. However, it is important to consider the resources and costs required to set up and maintain your site.

As a career counselor, it is my job to help you determine what careers you are most suited for based on your skills, interests, and experience. From the information you provided, it appears that you are interested in pursuing a career as a physical therapist working in the physical therapy industry.

First, let's take a look at your skills and interests. Physical therapists require a strong understanding of the human body and how it functions. They must also have excellent communication skills, as they work closely with patients and must be able to clearly explain treatment plans and procedures. Physical therapists also need to be patient, empathetic, and able to work well under pressure. Based on these requirements, it seems that you have the skills and interests necessary for a career in physical therapy.

Next, let's consider the job market trends in the physical therapy industry. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of physical therapists is projected to grow by 22% from 2020 to 2030, much faster than the average for all occupations. This growth is due to the increasing demand for physical therapy services as the population ages and the need for rehabilitation increases. Physical therapy is also an in-demand field due to the growing prevalence of chronic conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, which require physical therapy treatment.

As for qualifications, it is important to note that physical therapists must have a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree. This typically requires three years of full-time study and clinical education. In addition to this, physical therapists must also be licensed in order to practice. Requirements for licensure vary by state, but generally include completing an accredited DPT program and passing the National Physical Therapy Exam.

In conclusion, based on your skills, interests, and the job market trends in the physical therapy industry, it appears that a career as a physical therapist would be a good fit for you. I recommend that you research DPT programs and begin preparing for the licensure exam in order to pursue this career path. Best of luck to you on your professional journey!

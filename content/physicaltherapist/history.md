Physical therapist is a relatively modern term, with its first recorded usage dating back to the early 20th century. The word is derived from the Greek word "physikos," which means "natural," and the Latin word "therapeia," which means "healing." The combination of these two words forms the basis for the modern term "physical therapy," which refers to the use of physical means, such as exercise and massage, to promote healing and rehabilitation.

The concept of physical therapy has a much longer history, however, with roots dating back to ancient Greek and Roman times. In these civilizations, the focus was on using physical means to promote health and prevent illness. This included the use of exercise, massage, and other techniques to maintain physical fitness and promote overall well-being.

Over time, the meaning of the term physical therapy has evolved to encompass a wider range of techniques and approaches, including the use of technology and equipment to facilitate healing and rehabilitation. Today, physical therapy is a highly specialized field that involves the use of a variety of techniques to help individuals recover from injuries, surgeries, and other conditions that affect their physical abilities.

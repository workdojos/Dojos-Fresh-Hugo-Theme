As a philosopher, I would suggest starting by looking at the various ethical theories that exist within the field of philosophy. Some common ethical theories include deontology, which emphasizes the importance of following moral rules and duties; consequentialism, which focuses on the outcomes of actions; and virtue ethics, which emphasizes the importance of developing character traits that align with moral virtues.

In the context of starting a career as a physicist working in the physics and higher education industry, it might be helpful to consider how these different ethical theories might apply to the specific challenges and dilemmas that you might encounter in your work. For example, you might consider how deontology might inform your decision-making when it comes to following laws and regulations related to research, or how consequentialism might guide your approach to considering the potential impacts of your work on society.

It might also be helpful to consider the values and principles that are important to you personally, and how these might shape your ethical framework. For example, you might prioritize honesty, transparency, and fairness in your work, or you might prioritize the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

Ultimately, developing an ethical framework for your work as a physicist will require some level of reflection and introspection, as well as a willingness to consider and evaluate different perspectives and viewpoints. It may also involve seeking guidance and support from colleagues, mentors, and other resources within the field.

As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology for building your website for several reasons. First, it allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website, as you have access to the source code and can make changes as needed. This is especially useful for businesses in the physics and higher education industry, as you may have specific needs or requirements for your website that may not be available with proprietary software.

In addition, using open-source technology can also be cost-effective, as you don't have to pay for licenses or subscription fees. This can be especially important for small businesses or startups, as you may not have the budget for expensive proprietary software.

As for the specific open-source web builders and static-site generators that would be suitable for your business, some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and customization options, and are widely used in the industry. Other options include static-site generators like Jekyll or Hugo, which are useful for creating fast and lightweight websites.

It's important to consider the pros and cons of each option, as well as the costs involved in terms of hosting and maintenance. It may be worth consulting with a web developer or specialist to determine the best solution for your specific needs and budget. Ultimately, the most suitable open-source technology for your business will depend on your specific goals and requirements.

As a philosopher, I would recommend starting by considering the ethical theories of deontology and consequentialism.

Deontology is the belief that certain actions are morally right or wrong based on the inherent nature of the action itself, regardless of the consequences. In the context of starting a career as a playwright, this could mean considering whether it is ethical to prioritize personal success over the well-being of others, or whether it is morally wrong to plagiarize or steal ideas from other artists.

Consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the consequences of an action as the primary determinant of its moral value. In this case, a playwright may consider whether the potential consequences of their work, such as the impact on their audience or the cultural conversation, align with their own ethical values.

In addition to these ethical theories, it may also be helpful to consider the ethical principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice. Autonomy refers to the idea that individuals have the right to make their own decisions, which may be relevant when considering how to balance artistic expression with industry demands. Non-maleficence means avoiding harm, which may be relevant when considering the potential impact of one's work on marginalized groups. Beneficence means taking action to do good, which may be relevant when considering how to use one's platform to promote positive change. Justice is the idea of fairness and equality, which may be relevant when considering issues of representation and inclusion in the performing arts industry.

Overall, the development of an ethical framework for starting a career as a playwright should involve considering both the inherent nature of actions and their potential consequences, as well as ethical principles such as autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice.

As a playwright working in the performing arts industry, it is crucial that fair work practices are upheld and that workers are treated with respect and given proper wages for their contributions. In recent years, there have been numerous instances of exploitation and mistreatment of workers in the industry, particularly those who are just starting out or are considered to be "emerging" artists.

One trend that has emerged in the industry is the reliance on unpaid or low-paid internships as a means of gaining experience and building a resume. While these internships may seem like an opportunity for aspiring artists, they often result in workers being taken advantage of and not receiving fair compensation for their labor. In addition, many workers are required to work long hours and take on multiple internships or part-time jobs in order to make ends meet, leading to burnout and a lack of time to focus on their craft.

Another trend that has come to light in recent years is the lack of diversity and inclusion in the industry. Many workers, particularly those who are members of marginalized communities, have experienced discrimination and have been overlooked for opportunities due to biases within the industry. This lack of diversity has a negative impact on the quality and authenticity of the work being produced, and it is important that steps are taken to ensure that all workers are given equal opportunities and are treated fairly.

In order to promote fair work practices in the performing arts industry, it is crucial that workers are given fair wages for their labor and that internships are paid and provide a meaningful learning experience. It is also important that steps are taken to increase diversity and inclusion within the industry, and that all workers are treated with respect and given equal opportunities. By taking these actions, we can create a more sustainable and equitable industry for all workers.

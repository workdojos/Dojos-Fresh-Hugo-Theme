First of all, let me start by saying that becoming a playwright in the performing arts industry is a fantastic and rewarding career path! Not only will you have the opportunity to create and share your stories with the world, but you'll also get to be a part of the vibrant and dynamic world of theater and entertainment.

Here are a few little-known facts about working as a playwright that may surprise you:

Playwrights have the freedom to work on their own terms. While some playwrights prefer to work in a traditional theater setting, others choose to work independently, writing and producing their own work. This allows for a great deal of flexibility and creativity.

Playwrights can also make a significant impact on society. Through their writing, playwrights can shed light on important issues and spark discussions and debates about social justice, politics, and other important topics.

The performing arts industry is always growing and evolving. This means that there are always new opportunities for playwrights to showcase their work and reach new audiences.

Now, onto some useful resources for learning more about working as a playwright:

The Dramatists Guild of America (https://www.dramatistsguild.com/) is a great resource for playwrights, offering information on contracts, royalties, and other important aspects of the business.

The Playwrights' Center (https://pwcenter.org/) is another excellent resource, offering workshops, classes, and other opportunities for playwrights to hone their craft and network with other industry professionals.

For inspiration and information on the latest trends and developments in the industry, be sure to check out websites like Playbill (https://www.playbill.com/) and Broadway World (https://www.broadwayworld.com/).

Finally, don't forget to get excited about your career as a playwright! The performing arts industry is full of talented and creative individuals, and there's always room for new voices and perspectives. Embrace your passion for storytelling and remember that you have the potential to make a real difference through your work. Good luck, and keep writing!

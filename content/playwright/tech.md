The performing arts industry is a vital part of our society, providing entertainment, education, and cultural enrichment to communities around the world. As with any industry, the performing arts face a number of challenges, including the need to adapt to changing technologies and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. One solution that has the potential to revolutionize the industry is the use of open-source technology.

Open-source technology refers to software or other digital tools that are freely available for anyone to use and modify. In the performing arts industry, this could mean using open-source software for ticketing, marketing, and other business tasks. This would allow small performing arts organizations to access the same resources as larger companies, leveling the playing field and enabling them to thrive.

For playwrights and other creatives in the industry, open-source technology also has the potential to provide new opportunities for collaboration and distribution. With the ability to share and modify work freely, artists can work together more easily and reach a wider audience. This can be especially beneficial for those just starting out in the industry, as it gives them a chance to get their work seen and build a following without the need for expensive resources.

Small businesses are the backbone of a thriving economy, and the performing arts industry is no exception. By adopting open-source technology, small performing arts organizations can not only save money on expensive software, but also have the opportunity to innovate and create new products and services. This in turn can help stimulate the economy and create new jobs.

In conclusion, the adoption of open-source technology in the performing arts industry has the potential to benefit everyone involved. It can provide new opportunities for playwrights and small businesses, and ultimately contribute to a stronger economy. It is important for industry leaders to recognize the value of open-source technology and work towards implementing it in their own organizations.

As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons. First and foremost, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website. You have the ability to modify and tailor the website to meet your specific business goals and needs, rather than being limited by proprietary software. Additionally, open-source technology often has a larger community of developers and users, which can be helpful for finding solutions to any issues that may arise or for seeking out new features to incorporate into your website.

In terms of specific open-source web builders, static-site generators, and apps to consider, some popular options for building a website in the performing arts industry include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of customizable templates, plug-ins, and features to help you create a professional and engaging website for your business as a playwright.

It's worth noting that while open-source technology can offer many benefits, it does come with some potential drawbacks. One potential disadvantage is that you will be responsible for maintaining and updating your website yourself, which can be time-consuming. Additionally, there may be a learning curve associated with using open-source technology, which could require additional training or resources to fully utilize its capabilities.

In terms of cost, using open-source technology to build your own website will typically be more cost-effective than using proprietary software or hiring a web developer to build a website for you. However, it's important to factor in the time and resources required to maintain and update the website, as well as any additional costs associated with hosting or other resources needed to run the website.

Overall, I believe that using open-source technology to build your own website can be a great choice for a playwright in the performing arts industry, as it allows for greater flexibility and customization while also being cost-effective. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons, as well as the costs, before making a decision on which technology to use for your website.

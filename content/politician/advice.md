As a career counselor, I am here to help you explore your potential career options and provide guidance on which path may be the most suitable for you. Based on your desire to pursue a career as a politician working in the government and political campaign industry, I have conducted some research and would like to share my findings with you.

Firstly, it is important to consider your skills and experience when determining if a career in politics is the right fit for you. Some skills that may be beneficial for this industry include strong communication skills, the ability to persuade and negotiate, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work under pressure. It is also important to have a deep understanding of current political issues and a passion for public service.

In terms of job market trends, the political field can be competitive, and it is important to have a strong network and experience in campaigning or political organizing. It is also helpful to have a background in law, public policy, or a related field.

As for qualifications, a bachelor's degree is often the minimum requirement for entry-level positions in politics. However, some positions may require a graduate degree, such as a master's in public administration or political science. It is also helpful to have internships or volunteer experience in the political field to gain valuable hands-on experience.

Overall, a career in politics can be rewarding, but it can also be challenging. It is important to carefully consider your skills, interests, and experience before making a decision. I encourage you to continue researching and exploring your options to find the best fit for you.

I hope this information has been helpful, and please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or need additional guidance.

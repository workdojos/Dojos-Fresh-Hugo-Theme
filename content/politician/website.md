As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons. First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization compared to proprietary software. This means that you can tailor the website to your specific needs and requirements, rather than being limited by the capabilities of a pre-built platform. Additionally, open-source technology often has a larger community of developers and users, which means that you have access to a wider range of resources and support.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that can be used to build your website, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and capabilities, including the ability to easily create and edit content, manage users and permissions, and integrate with other tools and platforms.

In terms of the pros and cons of using open-source technology, one of the main benefits is the ability to customize and tailor the website to your specific needs. However, this also means that you will need to invest more time and resources into building and maintaining the website, as you will be responsible for updates and security patches. Additionally, while open-source technology is often free to use, you may still need to invest in hosting, domains, and other related costs.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can be a great way to create a custom, feature-rich website that meets your business goals and enhances user experience. Just be sure to carefully consider the costs and resources required to build and maintain the website, and make sure that you have the necessary technical expertise or support to ensure that the website is successful.

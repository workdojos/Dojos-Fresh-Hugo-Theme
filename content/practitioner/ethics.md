As a philosopher, I would begin by considering the various ethical theories that could potentially inform this ethical framework. Some potential options could include deontological ethics, which emphasizes the importance of upholding moral duties and principles, or consequentialist ethics, which focuses on the consequences of actions as the primary moral consideration.

I would also consider the specific ethical dilemmas that may arise in the healthcare industry, such as conflicts of interest, end-of-life decision-making, and the allocation of limited resources. It may be helpful to examine how other healthcare professionals have addressed these issues in the past, and to consider the values and priorities that are most important to you in your work.

Additionally, I would consider the broader social and cultural context in which you will be working, including the values and beliefs of your colleagues, patients, and the broader community. This may involve researching the ethical codes and guidelines that have been established by professional organizations in the healthcare field, and considering how these align with your own personal values and beliefs.

Ultimately, developing an ethical framework for a career in the healthcare industry will require a careful balance between upholding moral principles and navigating the complex and often challenging realities of this field. It may be helpful to seek guidance from colleagues or mentors who have experience in this area, and to stay up-to-date with current debates and developments in the field.

As a career counselor, it is my duty to assist you in determining the most suitable career path for you based on your skills, interests and experience.

Based on your desire to pursue a career as a project manager in the broader business industry, I recommend conducting some self-assessment to determine what skills and qualities you possess that may be beneficial in this field. Some key skills and qualities for project managers include excellent communication and leadership skills, the ability to work under pressure and meet deadlines, problem-solving skills, and strong organizational and time management skills.

In addition to these skills, it is important for project managers to have a strong foundation in business concepts such as finance, marketing, and strategy. If you have a background in business or have completed relevant coursework in these areas, it may be beneficial for you to highlight these skills and experiences in your resume and cover letter when applying for project management positions.

I also recommend researching the job market trends in the business industry to get a better understanding of the demand for project managers and the types of companies that are hiring for these positions. It may also be helpful to network with professionals in the industry and seek out internships or entry-level positions to gain hands-on experience and build your professional network.

As for qualifications, a bachelor's degree in a business-related field is typically required for project management positions. However, obtaining a master's degree in project management or a related field may increase your chances of being hired and give you an edge in the job market. Additionally, obtaining a certification in project management, such as the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification, may also be beneficial in demonstrating your knowledge and skills in the field.

Overall, pursuing a career as a project manager in the broader business industry may be a rewarding and challenging path for you based on your skills and interests. It is important to continue to develop your skills, gain relevant experience, and network with professionals in the industry to increase your chances of success in this field.

As a philosopher, one approach to developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a project manager in the broader business industry would be to consider the ethical theories of deontology and consequentialism.

Deontology, as proposed by philosopher Immanuel Kant, holds that the morality of an action should be determined by whether it follows a moral rule or duty. In the context of a project manager, this could involve following professional codes of conduct and ensuring that all team members are treated fairly and with respect.

Consequentialism, on the other hand, holds that the morality of an action should be determined by its consequences. For a project manager, this could involve considering the potential impact of their actions on stakeholders such as clients, team members, and the company as a whole.

One way to integrate these two theories into an ethical framework for a project manager would be to consider both the moral duties and responsibilities inherent in the role, as well as the potential consequences of actions on all stakeholders. This could involve prioritizing honesty and transparency in communication, ensuring that team members are treated with respect and fairness, and considering the potential long-term impacts of decisions on the company and its stakeholders.

Additionally, it may be helpful to consider other ethical frameworks such as virtue ethics, which emphasizes the development of moral character and virtues, or the principle of non-maleficence, which holds that one should do no harm.

Ultimately, the ethical framework for a project manager will depend on their personal values and the specific context of their work. By considering the various ethical theories and principles outlined above, a project manager can create a personalized ethical framework that guides their decision-making and actions in the workplace.

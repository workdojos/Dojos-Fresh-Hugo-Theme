The word "project" is derived from the Latin word "projectum", which means "something that is thrown forward". This word is derived from the Latin verb "proicere", which means "to throw forward". The word "project" has been in use in English since the 16th century and has always referred to a plan, proposal, or undertaking of some kind.

The word "manager" is derived from the Latin word "manuarius", which means "a servant who manages affairs". This word is derived from the Latin word "manus", which means "hand" or "power". The word "manager" has been in use in English since the late 17th century and originally referred to someone who was responsible for managing a household or estate.

The term "business" is derived from the Old English word "bisignis", which means "concern, trade, occupation". This word is derived from the Old English verb "bysignan", which means "to be busy".

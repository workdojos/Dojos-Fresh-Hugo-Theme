As a project manager working in the broader business industry, it is essential that fair work practices are maintained. Recently, there have been several trends and events that have highlighted the need for worker’s rights, fair treatment, and proper wages.

One of the most significant trends in the industry has been the rise of the gig economy. This trend has seen an increase in the number of workers who are classified as independent contractors rather than employees. This classification allows companies to avoid paying benefits, such as healthcare and retirement, and often results in lower wages for workers. This trend is particularly concerning for project managers, as it can lead to unstable work and an uncertain future.

In addition to the gig economy trend, there have been several recent events that have highlighted the importance of fair work practices in the business industry. For example, the Black Lives Matter movement has brought attention to the issue of systemic racism in the workplace. Many workers, particularly those from marginalized communities, face discrimination and mistreatment on the job. It is crucial that project managers work to address these issues and promote a culture of inclusivity and equality in the workplace.

In conclusion, fair work practices are essential for project managers working in the broader business industry. Recent trends and events have highlighted the need for worker’s rights, fair treatment, and proper wages. Project managers must take a stand for these values and work to create a more equitable and just workplace.``

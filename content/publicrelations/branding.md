Sure, I can definitely help with that! Here are some specific steps I would take as your social media manager:

Develop a social media strategy: First, I would work with you to identify the specific goals you want to achieve on social media (e.g. increasing brand awareness, recruiting followers, driving traffic to your website, etc.). From there, I would create a detailed social media strategy that outlines the specific tactics and content we will use to reach those goals.

Create engaging content: I would work with you to create a content calendar that outlines the types of content we will post and when we will post them. This might include blog posts, infographics, quotes, or any other content that is relevant to your organization and will engage your followers.

Monitor conversations: Using community management tools, I would regularly monitor conversations on social media to identify any questions or comments from followers that need a response. I would also keep an eye out for any potential collaboration opportunities with other organizations in the public relations industry.

Engage with the audience: I would make sure to regularly respond to comments and questions from followers, as well as engage with other users on social media (e.g. by liking and commenting on their posts). This will help to build a sense of community and show that you are actively listening to your followers.

Use analytics to measure success: I would use analytics tools to track the performance of our social media campaigns and measure our progress towards meeting our goals. This will help us to identify what is working well and where we might need to make adjustments to our strategy.

Overall, my goal as your social media manager would be to create a strong, active presence for your organization on social media, and to help you achieve your specific goals for using these platforms.

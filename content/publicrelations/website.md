As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, using open-source technology allows you to have complete control over the design and functionality of your website. With proprietary platforms, you are often limited to the templates and features provided by the company, but with open-source technology, you can customize your website to meet your specific needs and preferences.

In addition, open-source technology is often more cost-effective than proprietary platforms. While you may have to invest in hosting and maintenance costs, these costs are typically lower than the subscription fees associated with proprietary platforms.

There are also a wide variety of open-source web builders and static-site generators available, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Hugo, that can help you build a professional-looking website without the need for extensive coding knowledge.

One potential downside of using open-source technology is the need for technical expertise in order to properly set up and maintain your website. However, there are many resources available to help you navigate this process, including online tutorials and forums, and hiring a web developer to assist with the setup and maintenance of your website can also be an option.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your website can provide a great user experience while also meeting your business goals and helping you save on costs. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons and costs associated with each option before making a decision.

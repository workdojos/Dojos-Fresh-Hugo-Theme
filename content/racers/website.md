As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows you to access a wide range of free and high-quality tools and resources that can help you create a professional-grade website. This can save you a significant amount of money on development costs, as you won't have to pay for proprietary software or licenses.

Additionally, open-source technology gives you the freedom to customize and modify your website to fit your specific needs and preferences. This can be especially useful if you are working in a niche industry like racing and spectator sports, as you may have specific requirements that are not met by off-the-shelf solutions.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that you can use to create your website, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of templates, plugins, and customization options, making it easy to create a professional-looking website without the need for advanced coding skills.

Another option to consider is using a static-site generator like Gatsby or Next.js. These tools allow you to build a website using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they are particularly useful if you need to create a fast-loading, lightweight website that can handle large amounts of traffic.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your website include cost savings, flexibility, and access to a wide range of high-quality tools and resources. The main disadvantage is that you may need to invest more time and effort into learning how to use these tools and configure your website, but the long-term benefits of having a fully customizable and scalable website are well worth it.

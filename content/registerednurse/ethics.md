As a philosopher, I would first consider the principles of ethical theories such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. Utilitarianism emphasizes the greatest good for the greatest number, and a registered nurse may consider this by prioritizing the well-being and happiness of their patients. Deontology emphasizes the importance of following moral rules and duties, and a registered nurse may consider this by upholding the ethical codes and standards set by the nursing profession. Virtue ethics emphasizes the development of character traits such as compassion and empathy, and a registered nurse may consider this by striving to cultivate these virtues in their personal and professional life.

Additionally, I would consider the various stakeholders involved in the healthcare industry, including patients, healthcare providers, and healthcare institutions, and how the actions of a registered nurse may impact them. It may be helpful to consider how to balance the needs and interests of these different groups in order to make ethical decisions.

Finally, I would consider the social and cultural context in which a registered nurse is practicing, and how this may impact their ethical framework. For example, the values and beliefs of a community may shape their understanding of what is considered ethical in healthcare. It may be important for a registered nurse to consider these cultural norms and values in their ethical decision-making process.

Overall, the development of an ethical framework for a career as a registered nurse working in the healthcare industry requires careful consideration of various ethical theories, stakeholders, and cultural context. It is important for a registered nurse to continuously reflect on and evaluate their ethical decision-making process in order to ensure that they are acting in a way that aligns with their values and upholds the ethical standards of their profession.

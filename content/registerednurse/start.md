vFirst of all, let me just say that becoming a registered nurse is an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling career choice. Not only do you have the opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of others, but you also have the opportunity to work in an exciting and growing industry with plenty of upside potential. Here are a few little-known facts about working as a registered nurse in the healthcare industry:

Registered nurses are in high demand. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that employment of registered nurses will grow by 15% from 2019 to 2029, which is much faster than the average for all occupations. This means that you will likely have plenty of job opportunities once you graduate from nursing school.

Registered nurses have a wide range of career options. You can work in a hospital, a nursing home, a home health agency, a physician's office, or a variety of other settings. You can also specialize in a particular area of nursing, such as pediatrics, gerontology, or oncology, to name just a few examples.

Registered nurses earn a good salary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for registered nurses was $73,300 in May 2020. This is a good salary, especially when you consider the important work that you will be doing.

Registered nurses have the opportunity to advance their careers. Many registered nurses go on to earn advanced degrees, such as a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) or a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). These advanced degrees can lead to higher salaries and more leadership opportunities.

To get started on your journey to becoming a registered nurse, I recommend checking out the following websites:

American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN): https://www.aacnnursing.org/
National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN): https://www.ncsbn.org/
National Association of Registered Nurses (NARN): https://www.narn.org/
I also recommend speaking with current registered nurses to get a sense of what it's really like to work in this field. You can find registered nurses at your local hospital or nursing home, or you can connect with them through professional nursing organizations.

Remember, becoming a registered nurse is a challenging but rewarding journey. With hard work, dedication, and a positive attitude, you can achieve your goal and make a real difference in the lives of others. Keep pushing forward and you will succeed!

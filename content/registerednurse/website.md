As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website. You have the ability to modify and tweak the code to fit your specific business needs and goals. This can be particularly beneficial if you are working in the healthcare industry, as you may have specific requirements or needs that are not met by traditional proprietary web builders.

Second, open-source technology often has a larger community of developers and users, which can be a valuable resource for support and troubleshooting. If you run into any issues or have questions about your website, you can often find answers and solutions from the community.

Third, using open-source technology can be a cost-effective option for building a website. Many open-source web builders and static-site generators are free to use, and you can host your website on your own server, which can save you money on hosting fees.

Some of the leading open-source web builders and static-site generators that you might consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a range of features and capabilities, including the ability to create custom pages, add multimedia content, and manage users and permissions.

Other popular open-source apps that you might consider include GIMP (a free image editing software), LibreOffice (a free office suite), and OpenShot (a free video editor). These tools can be useful for creating and editing content for your website.

There are also some potential drawbacks to using open-source technology. One concern is that it may require a certain level of technical knowledge or expertise to customize and maintain your website. You may need to invest time and resources into learning how to use the technology and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your own website far outweigh the potential drawbacks. It allows for greater flexibility, customization, and cost-effectiveness, and it can be a valuable resource for support and troubleshooting.

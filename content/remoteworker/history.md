Remote worker:

The term "remote worker" refers to an individual who works from a location outside of a traditional office setting, often remotely connected to their employer through technology such as a computer or phone. The origin of this term can be traced back to the late 20th century, when advancements in communication and information technology allowed for more flexible and decentralized work arrangements.

The word "remote" itself has its roots in the Latin word "remotus," which means "distant" or "removed." This Latin root is also the source of other English words related to distance and separation, such as "remove" and "remotely."

In terms of its meaning, the term "remote worker" has remained relatively consistent over time, referring to an individual who works remotely rather than in a traditional office setting. However, with the increase in remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the term has gained more widespread use and recognition in recent years.

Freelance:

The term "freelance" refers to a person who works independently, rather than being employed by a company or organization. The origin of this term can be traced back to the medieval period, when knights were known as "freelancers" because they were not affiliated with any particular lord or lord's army. These knights were free to choose which lord or cause they would serve, and were often hired on a contract or per-project basis.

The word "freelance" itself is derived from the Old French word "frele," which means "free" or "free man." This French root is also the source of other English words related to freedom, such as "free" and "freely."

In terms of its meaning, the term "freelance" has remained relatively consistent over time, referring to an individual who works independently rather than being employed by a company or organization. However, the term has gained more widespread use and recognition in recent years due to the increase in freelance work opportunities in the digital age.

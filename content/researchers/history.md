The word "researcher" comes from the Old French word "recercher," which means "to search again" or "to investigate." This word ultimately derives from the Latin "re-" meaning "again" and "quaerere" meaning "to seek." The word was first recorded in English in the mid-16th century with the meaning "one who searches again or investigates."

The phrase "scientific research and development" is a bit more complex. The word "scientific" comes from the Latin "scientens," which means "knowing." This word derives from the verb "scire," which means "to know." The phrase "research and development" refers to the process of studying and experimenting in order to improve or create new products or knowledge. This phrase has been in use since the early 20th century.

Over time, the meaning of the word "researcher" has remained relatively unchanged, referring to someone who investigates or searches for information. The phrase "scientific research and development" has also remained largely unchanged, referring to the process of studying and experimenting in order to improve or create new products or knowledge in a scientific context.

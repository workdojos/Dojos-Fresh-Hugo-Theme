As a philosopher, one approach to developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a retailer in the retail industry might be to consider the principles of consequentialism and deontology.

Consequentialism is the ethical theory that holds that the consequences of an action are the ultimate determinant of its moral value. In other words, an action is considered morally right if it leads to good consequences, and wrong if it leads to bad consequences. This approach might lead a retailer to consider the potential effects of their actions on stakeholders such as employees, customers, and the community, and to strive to make decisions that will have positive consequences for all parties involved.

Deontology, on the other hand, is the ethical theory that holds that certain actions are morally right or wrong regardless of their consequences. According to this approach, certain moral duties or rules must be followed, regardless of the outcome. A retailer operating under a deontological ethical framework might consider their moral obligations to treat customers and employees fairly and with respect, regardless of the impact this has on profits or other outcomes.

In developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a retailer, it may also be useful to consider other philosophical approaches such as virtue ethics, which emphasizes the development of good character traits, or the social contract theory, which posits that individuals give up certain rights in exchange for the protection and benefits of living in a society. Ultimately, the most effective ethical framework for a retailer may be a combination of these approaches, tailored to fit the specific values and goals of the individual and the business.

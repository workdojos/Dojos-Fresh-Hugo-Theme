The word retailer comes from the Latin verb "re" meaning "back" and "tail" meaning "cut." Originally, it referred to someone who would cut off small pieces of a larger piece of fabric or goods for sale.

The word retail comes from the Old French word "retailler," which means "to cut again." It originally referred to the act of cutting off small pieces of a larger piece of fabric or goods for sale.

In modern English, both retailer and retail refer to the sale of goods or services to the end consumer, usually in small quantities. The retailer is the person or business that sells the goods or services, while retail refers to the act of selling or the market in which the goods or services are sold.

The meanings of both words have evolved over time to refer specifically to the sale of goods or services to the end consumer, but their roots in the act of cutting off small pieces of a larger whole can still be seen.

As a career counselor, I would first assess the individual's skills and interests to determine if they are well-suited for a career as a sales coach. Some key skills that are important for success in this role include strong communication and interpersonal skills, a high level of self-motivation and drive, and the ability to work well under pressure.

Based on the individual's experience and interests, I would also recommend researching the job market trends in the executive coaching industry to see what types of opportunities are currently available. It is also important to consider any qualifications or certifications that may be necessary to pursue this career path.

In terms of qualifications, a bachelor's degree in a related field such as business or psychology may be beneficial for this type of role. Additionally, obtaining a certification as a sales coach or executive coach could also increase the individual's chances of success in this field.

Overall, a career as a sales coach in the executive coaching industry can be highly rewarding for individuals who are passionate about helping others achieve their goals and are skilled in communication and motivation. With the right skills, experience, and qualifications, this individual could potentially thrive in this role.

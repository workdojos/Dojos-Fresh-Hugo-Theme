Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign to promote your new business as a sales coach:

Instagram: Share behind-the-scenes photos and videos of you at work, interacting with clients and colleagues. Use relevant hashtags and engage with your followers by asking them questions and inviting them to share their own experiences in the sales industry.

Twitter: Tweet valuable tips and insights on sales techniques and strategies, and use Twitter to engage with other professionals in the executive coaching industry. Share quotes and articles related to sales and leadership development.

YouTube: Create a series of videos sharing your expert advice on sales techniques and strategies, and share these videos on your social media channels. Consider inviting guest experts or conducting interviews with successful sales professionals.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring resources, tips, and inspiration related to sales and leadership development. Share your own content as well as content from other industry experts. Invite your followers to share their own content by using relevant hashtags.

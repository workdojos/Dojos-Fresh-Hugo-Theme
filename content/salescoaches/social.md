Twitter: Tweet valuable tips and insights on sales techniques and strategies, and use Twitter to engage with other professionals in the executive coaching industry. Share quotes and articles related to sales and leadership development.

YouTube: Create a series of videos sharing your expert advice on sales techniques and strategies, and share these videos on your social media channels. Consider inviting guest experts or conducting interviews with successful sales professionals.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring resources, tips, and inspiration related to sales and leadership development. Share your own content as well as content from other industry experts. Invite your followers to share their own content by using relevant hashtags.

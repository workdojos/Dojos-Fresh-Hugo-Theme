As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website. With proprietary software, you are often limited to the features and functionality provided by the company. However, with open-source technology, you have access to the source code and can make changes and additions as needed to fit your specific business goals and needs.

Second, open-source technology is often more cost-effective than proprietary software. While there may be upfront costs for setup and development, the long-term maintenance and upgrades are often free, as the community of developers continually updates and improves the technology. This can save your business a significant amount of money in the long run.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that could be suitable for your business as a sales coach in the executive coaching industry. Some options to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal for web builders, and Gatsby and Hugo for static-site generators. Each of these options has its own pros and cons, so it is important to carefully evaluate which one would best meet your business needs and goals.

It is also important to consider the costs associated with each option. While open-source technology is often more cost-effective in the long run, there may be upfront costs for setup and development. It is important to carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of each option to determine which one is the most suitable for your business.

In summary, using open-source technology to build your website can offer greater flexibility and customization, as well as cost-effectiveness in the long run. There are several popular options to consider, and it is important to carefully evaluate the pros and cons, as well as the costs, to determine which one is the most suitable for your business.

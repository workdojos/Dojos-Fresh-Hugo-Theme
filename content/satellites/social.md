Sure, I'd be happy to help you create an engaging campaign to promote your new business on social media. Here are some tips to get you started:

Determine your goals: Before you start creating content, it's important to know what you want to achieve with your social media campaign. Do you want to increase brand awareness, drive traffic to your website, or generate leads? Knowing your goals will help you create a campaign that is focused and effective.

Identify your target audience: Understanding who you are trying to reach will help you create content that resonates with your audience and encourages them to take action. Consider demographics like age, location, and interests when identifying your target audience.

Create compelling content: To engage your followers and promote your business, you'll need to create content that is interesting, informative, and visually appealing. Use high-quality photos and videos, and be sure to include relevant hashtags to help your content get discovered.

Engage with your followers: Interacting with your followers is a key part of building a successful social media presence. Take the time to respond to comments and messages, and consider running contests or giveaways to encourage engagement.

Use paid advertising: While organic reach on social media can be limited, paid advertising can help you reach a larger audience and achieve your goals faster. Consider using paid advertising options like Instagram sponsored posts or Twitter promoted tweets to get your content in front of more people.

I hope these tips are helpful as you start planning your social media campaign. Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance.

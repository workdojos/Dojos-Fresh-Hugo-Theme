As a philosopher, I would first consider the fundamental principles and values that should guide ethical decision-making in the education industry. These could include concepts such as justice, fairness, equality, and the promotion of the common good.

Next, I would research various philosophical theories on education and its role in society, such as John Dewey's idea of education as a means of promoting personal and societal growth, or Paulo Freire's belief in the importance of critical consciousness in education.

With these principles and theories in mind, I would then consider the specific ethical dilemmas and challenges that a school teacher may face in their career. For example, how can a teacher balance the needs and rights of individual students with the needs of the class as a whole? How can a teacher promote equity and inclusion in the classroom, and what actions should be taken if these principles are violated?

Based on this analysis, I would then propose an ethical framework for starting a career as a school teacher, outlining the guiding principles and values that should inform decision-making, as well as specific strategies and actions that can be taken to promote ethical practice in the education industry. This framework could be used as a guide for personal reflection and decision-making, as well as a resource for ongoing professional development and ethical growth.

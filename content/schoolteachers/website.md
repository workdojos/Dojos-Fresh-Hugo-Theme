As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

Firstly, open-source technology is free to use, which can be a significant cost-saving measure for a small business or individual like yourself. You can also customize the code to fit your specific needs, as the source code is available for modification and redistribution. This can be especially beneficial for a school teacher looking to tailor the website to fit the needs of their students and parents.

There are also many popular open-source web builders, static-site generators, and apps available that can be used to create a high-quality website. Some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which are user-friendly content management systems that allow you to easily update and manage your website. Static-site generators like Jekyll and Hugo are also great options for creating fast, lightweight websites.

One potential downside to using open-source technology is that you may need to invest some time and effort into learning how to use it effectively. However, there are plenty of resources available online to help you get started, including tutorials, forums, and community support.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can be a cost-effective and customizable solution for a small business or individual looking to create a website that meets their specific needs and goals.

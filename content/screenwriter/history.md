Screenwriter:

The word "screenwriter" can be traced back to the early 20th century, when motion pictures were first being made. The term "screenwriter" refers to a person who writes the screenplay for a film or television show. The word "screen" in this context refers to the fact that the written work is intended to be shown on a screen, such as a movie theater or television screen.

The word "screenwriter" has remained relatively unchanged in meaning since it was first coined. However, the role of the screenwriter has evolved over time as the medium of film and television has evolved. In the early days of motion pictures, screenwriters were often responsible for writing the entire script, including dialogue, stage directions, and character descriptions. Today, screenwriters may collaborate with other members of the production team, such as directors and producers, to develop the script.

Film:

The word "film" can be traced back to the early 19th century, when the medium of photography was first being developed. The term "film" refers to a thin, transparent sheet of material that was used to record images in the early days of photography. Over time, the meaning of the word "film" has evolved to encompass all forms of recorded media, including both still images and moving images.

In the early 20th century, "film" was used to refer specifically to motion pictures, or movies. Today, the word "film" is often used to refer to any recorded media that can be shown on a screen, whether it is a movie, television show, or video. The word "film" has also been used to refer to the medium of film as a whole, including the process of making and distributing movies.

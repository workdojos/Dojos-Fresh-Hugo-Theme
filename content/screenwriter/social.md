Sure! Here are some potential ideas for an engaging social media campaign to promote your new business as a screenwriter:

Share behind-the-scenes photos and videos on Instagram and Twitter of your writing process and the film industry in general. This will give your followers a glimpse into your world and make them feel more connected to your work.

Share quotes and advice on Pinterest that relate to screenwriting and the film industry. This could include quotes from successful screenwriters, tips for getting started in the industry, or links to helpful resources.

Create a YouTube channel where you share videos about your writing process, the film industry, and your journey as a screenwriter. This could include vlogs, interviews with industry professionals, or tutorials on screenwriting techniques.

Engage with followers on all platforms by asking for their opinions on your work, answering questions about the film industry, and sharing relevant content from other sources. This will help build a community around your brand and encourage more people to follow you.

Consider partnering with other influencers or brands in the film industry to create cross-promotional content and reach a wider audience. This could include sharing each other's content on social media, collaborating on a project, or hosting a Q&A session.

Overall, the key is to be authentic and engaging, and to share valuable content that your followers will find interesting and informative. Good luck with your new business!

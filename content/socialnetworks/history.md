The word "social media manager" originated from the combination of two words: "social" and "media." The word "social" comes from the Latin word "socialis," which means "allied" or "companion." The word "media" comes from the Latin word "medius," which means "middle" or "in between." Together, the term "social media" refers to the use of digital technologies and platforms to create and share content, connect with others, and engage in online communities.

The term "social media manager" refers to a person who is responsible for managing and optimizing a company's social media presence. This may involve creating and scheduling content, interacting with followers, and analyzing data to determine the effectiveness of social media campaigns.

Together, the term "sales and marketing" refers to the process of promoting and selling products or services to customers. This may involve research, advertising, and customer service.

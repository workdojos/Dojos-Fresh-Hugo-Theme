As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology allows you to have complete control over your website. With proprietary software, you are limited in terms of customization and may have to pay additional fees to access certain features. With open-source technology, you have access to the source code and can modify it to meet your specific needs.

Second, open-source technology often has a strong community support system. This means that there are likely forums, documentation, and other resources available to help you troubleshoot any issues you may encounter while building your website.

Third, open-source technology is often more cost-effective compared to proprietary software. While you may have to invest in hosting and server costs, you will not have to pay for licenses or additional fees for access to certain features.

There are many open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other popular open-source apps available to choose from. Some popular options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal for web builders, and Gatsby and Jekyll for static-site generators.

One potential downside to using open-source technology is that you may have to invest more time and effort into building and maintaining your website compared to using a proprietary platform. However, the benefits of having complete control and customization, as well as the cost savings, often outweigh this drawback.

Ultimately, the best option for your business will depend on your specific needs and goals. I recommend doing thorough research and considering the pros and cons of each option before making a decision.

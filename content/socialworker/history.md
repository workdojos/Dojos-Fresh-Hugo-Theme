The word "social worker" has its roots in the late 19th century, when the term was first used to describe individuals who worked in charitable organizations to help improve the lives of the poor and disadvantaged. The term "social" in this context refers to the idea of working within a community or society to address social issues and problems.

The term "behavioral health" has its roots in the field of psychology, which developed in the early 20th century as a way to understand and treat mental health issues. The term "behavioral" in this context refers to the idea of studying and addressing behavior and mental processes, while "health" refers to the overall well-being and functioning of an individual.

Over time, the meanings of these terms have evolved and expanded. Social workers today may work in a variety of settings, including schools, hospitals, and government agencies, and may focus on issues such as child welfare, substance abuse, and mental health. Behavioral health, on the other hand, has become a broader term that encompasses a range of mental health and wellness issues, including addiction, mood disorders, and stress management.2

As a web design consultant, I would suggest considering the use of open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

First, using open-source technology allows for greater customization and flexibility in terms of design and functionality. With access to the source code, you can tailor the website to meet your specific needs and preferences, rather than being limited to the features and templates offered by proprietary software.

Second, open-source technology often has a strong community of developers and users who contribute to its development and offer support. This can be particularly useful when you encounter issues or need help implementing certain features.

Third, using open-source technology can also be cost-effective, as many of these tools and platforms are free to use. While there may be costs associated with hosting or custom development, these can often be lower than the costs of proprietary software licenses and maintenance fees.

There are many popular open-source web builders and static-site generators to choose from, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and customization options, and are suitable for businesses of all sizes and industries. Other popular open-source apps that can enhance the overall user experience include social media integration, e-commerce functionality, and interactive forms.

It's worth considering the pros and cons of each option, as well as the potential costs associated with hosting and custom development. However, overall, using open-source technology can provide a great overall experience and allow you to build a website that meets the specific needs and goals of your business as a social worker in the behavioral health industry.

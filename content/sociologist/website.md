As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology for building your website for several reasons.

Firstly, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization. Since the source code is open, you can make changes and add features to your website as needed, without being restricted by proprietary software or licenses. This can be particularly useful for a sociologist working in the social sciences industry, as you may need to display complex data or incorporate specialized tools and features into your website.

Secondly, using open-source technology can help you save money on website development costs. Many open-source web builders and static-site generators are free to use, and you can find a wide range of open-source apps and plugins that can be integrated into your website at little or no cost. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses or individuals on a tight budget.

Finally, open-source technology has a strong community of developers and users who contribute to its growth and development. This means that you can access a wealth of knowledge and support from others who are using the same tools and technologies as you, which can be extremely helpful when building and maintaining your website.

Some of the leading open-source web builders and static-site generators that you might consider using include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a range of features and capabilities, and are widely used in the business and social sciences industries. Other popular open-source apps that you might consider include GIMP (for image editing), LibreOffice (for productivity), and Moodle (for online learning).

It's important to note that there are also some potential downsides to using open-source technology. For example, you may need to invest more time and effort into learning how to use the tools and technologies, and you may need to manage your own website hosting and maintenance. However, overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your website far outweigh any potential downsides.

In terms of costs, it's difficult to provide an exact figure without more specific details about your website and business needs. However, in general, using open-source technology can help you save money on website development costs compared to using proprietary software or hiring a web design agency. It's always a good idea to carefully consider your budget and resources before embarking on any website development project.

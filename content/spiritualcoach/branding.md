First, I would begin by conducting a thorough audit of the organization's current social media presence. This includes analyzing current followers, engagement, and content strategy. From there, I would create a comprehensive social media plan that includes specific goals, target audience, and key performance indicators to track progress.

Next, I would focus on building a strong presence on Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. This would involve creating engaging and relevant content, using relevant hashtags, and interacting with followers and other industry professionals. I would also work on increasing the organization's followers by using Twitter and Instagram features such as promoted posts and Instagram stories.

Additionally, I would utilize Pinterest to showcase the organization's services and resources, as well as connect with other coaches and industry professionals. I would also work on creating and implementing Pinterest ads to reach a wider audience.

Finally, I would regularly monitor and analyze the organization's social media performance using tools such as Hootsuite or Sprout Social to track engagement, website traffic, and conversions. I would then use this data to make any necessary adjustments to the social media strategy in order to achieve the desired results.

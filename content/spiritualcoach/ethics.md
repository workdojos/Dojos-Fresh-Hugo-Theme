As a philosopher, I would approach this question by first defining what is meant by an ethical framework. An ethical framework is a set of guiding principles or values that inform an individual's actions and decision-making. It provides a framework for determining right and wrong, and helps to ensure that actions align with one's personal values and beliefs.

In the context of starting a career as a spiritual coach, an ethical framework could include principles such as integrity, honesty, respect, and compassion. It could also include values such as helping others to grow and achieve their goals, being open and non-judgmental, and maintaining confidentiality.

To develop an ethical framework for this career, it may be helpful to research various philosophical theories on ethics, such as Kantian ethics, Utilitarianism, and Virtue ethics. These theories can provide insight into different approaches to ethical decision-making and can help to guide the development of a personal ethical framework.

It may also be helpful to seek guidance from other spiritual coaches or mentors who have experience in the industry and can provide insight and guidance on ethical considerations.

Ultimately, an ethical framework for a career as a spiritual coach should be based on one's personal values and beliefs, and should be tailored to the specific needs and goals of the individual. It is important to continuously reflect on and revise this framework as one grows and evolves in their career.

The word "coaching" comes from the Middle English term "coache," which referred to a large carriage that was used to transport people from one place to another. The word "coache" itself comes from the Old French term "coches," which referred to a type of carriage or coach.

The word "coaching" began to take on a more figurative meaning in the 18th century, when it came to refer to the act of providing guidance and instruction to someone in order to help them improve in a particular area. This sense of the word is still in use today, and is often used in the context of sports or business.

The term "spiritual coach" is a more recent invention, and refers to someone who provides guidance and support to individuals as they seek to grow and develop spiritually. This term likely derives from the more general concept of coaching, with the added element of a spiritual focus. The meaning of the word "spiritual" itself comes from the Latin term "spiritus," which refers to the breath or spirit of a person. Over time, the word has come to refer to matters related to the soul or the spirit, rather than just the physical breath.

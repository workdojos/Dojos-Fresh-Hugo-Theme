To research your options further, consider networking with professionals in the sponsorship industry and learning about the various types of sponsorship opportunities available. You might also consider joining a professional organization, such as the International Association of Sponsorship Marketing (IASM), to learn more about the field and connect with others in the industry.

Finally, it's important to be aware of job market trends in the sponsorship industry. Sponsorship is a growing field, with many opportunities in a variety of industries, including sports, entertainment, and events. However, competition for sponsorship positions can be fierce, so it's important to have a strong resume and networking skills to stand out.

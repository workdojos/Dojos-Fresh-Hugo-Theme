The word "statistician" comes from the Latin word "statisticus," which means "pertaining to the state." This word was derived from the Greek word "statistikos," which means "of or relating to affairs of state." The first recorded use of the word "statistician" was in the early 18th century, and it referred to someone who collected and analyzed data about the state or government.

The word "statistical" also comes from the Latin "statisticus," and it refers to the collection and analysis of data for the purpose of making informed decisions or predictions. The first recorded use of the word "statistical" was in the early 19th century, and it was used to describe the use of statistics in research or decision-making.

The field of statistical research and development has a long history dating back to ancient civilizations, when people used data and statistical analysis to make decisions about things like crop yields, population size, and military strategy. In modern times, statistical research and development has become a vital part of many fields, including economics, finance, healthcare, and marketing, and it plays a crucial role in the development of new products and technologies.

As a career counselor, I would recommend that you consider pursuing a career as a strategist in the consulting industry if you have strong analytical skills, excellent problem-solving abilities, and the ability to think strategically. These skills are essential for success in this field, as strategists are responsible for developing and implementing effective business plans and strategies for their clients.

To determine if this career is a good fit for you, I recommend that you assess your interests and skills to determine if they align with the responsibilities of a strategist in the consulting industry. For example, do you enjoy analyzing data and finding creative solutions to complex problems? Do you have strong communication skills and the ability to present your ideas effectively to others? These are all important factors to consider when determining if this career is right for you.

In terms of qualifications, a bachelor's or master's degree in business, economics, or a related field is typically required to enter the consulting industry. In addition, industry-specific certifications, such as a Certified Management Consultant (CMC) or a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), can be beneficial for those looking to enter this field.

It's also important to research the job market trends in the consulting industry to ensure that there is demand for strategists with your skill set. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of management analysts, which includes strategists, is expected to grow by 14% from 2019 to 2029, faster than the average for all occupations. This growth is driven by an increasing demand for consulting services from businesses looking to improve efficiency and increase profits.

Overall, pursuing a career as a strategist in the consulting industry can be a rewarding and fulfilling choice for those with strong analytical skills and the ability to think strategically. I recommend conducting further research and speaking with professionals in this field to get a better understanding of the day-to-day responsibilities and potential career path.

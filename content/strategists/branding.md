Sure, I can certainly help with that! Here are some strategies I would recommend:

Twitter:
Utilize hashtags relevant to the consulting industry, such as #consulting, #strategy, and #leadership. This will help your tweets reach a wider audience.
Engage with other users in the consulting industry by retweeting their content and responding to their tweets. This will help build relationships and increase your visibility.
Share valuable content, such as articles, infographics, and tips related to consulting. This will help attract followers who are interested in your content.
Instagram:
Use visually appealing images and graphics to showcase your consulting services and highlight your expertise.
Engage with your audience by responding to comments and asking for their opinions or feedback.
Utilize Instagram stories to share behind-the-scenes glimpses of your team and your work. This will help humanize your brand and make it more relatable.
Pinterest:
Create boards that showcase your consulting services, as well as boards that highlight industry-specific topics.
Pin images and articles that demonstrate your expertise and provide valuable information for your followers.
Engage with other users by commenting on their pins and repinning their content.
Overall, it's important to regularly post engaging content, engage with your audience, and utilize relevant hashtags to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to your website. I hope these suggestions help!

Strategist:

The word strategist is derived from the Greek word "strategos," which means "general" or "commander." This word has its roots in the ancient Greek military, where strategists were responsible for developing and implementing strategies for winning battles.

The meaning of the word has evolved over time to refer to any person who is skilled at developing and implementing strategies, whether in a military or business context. Today, strategists can be found in a variety of fields, including business, politics, and sports.

Consulting:

The word consulting is derived from the Latin word "consultare," which means "to discuss" or "to seek advice." This word was originally used to describe the process of seeking advice or counsel from others, often in the context of making important decisions.

Over time, the meaning of the word has expanded to refer to the act of providing professional advice or expertise to clients in a variety of fields. Today, consulting is often used to describe the work of firms or individuals who provide guidance and support to businesses and organizations in areas such as management, strategy, and technology.

Sure thing! Here are some ideas for creating an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest to promote your new business as a strategist in the consulting industry:

Create an Instagram account and post high-quality photos and videos showcasing your business, your team, and your services. Use relevant hashtags and engage with your followers by responding to comments and DM’s.

Use Twitter to share updates and insights about your business, as well as industry news and trends. Use hashtags and tweet at other influencers or businesses in your industry to increase your reach.

Create a YouTube channel and start a vlog series or create educational videos about your services and the consulting industry. Engage with your viewers by asking for their opinions and feedback in the comments section.

Use Pinterest to create boards featuring your business and the consulting industry. Pin images of your team, your services, and industry-related content to your boards and engage with your followers by liking and commenting on their pins.

Overall, the key to creating an engaging campaign on social media is to be authentic and consistent, and to actively engage with your followers. Good luck!

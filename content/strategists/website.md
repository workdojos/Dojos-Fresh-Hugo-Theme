As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons. Firstly, open-source technology is free to use, which can be a significant cost saving for businesses. It also allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website, as you have access to the source code and can make changes as needed. Additionally, open-source technology is supported by a large community of developers, which means that you can easily find help and resources if you encounter any issues.

Some of the leading open-source web builders that could be suitable for your business include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a range of features and customization options, and are suitable for businesses of all sizes.

Static-site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo are also popular options for building websites, as they allow you to create fast, lightweight websites that are easy to maintain.

Other popular open-source apps that could be useful for your business include Google Analytics for tracking website traffic and user behavior, and MailChimp for email marketing.

The main pros of using open-source technology to build your website include the cost savings, flexibility, and community support. However, it is important to consider the potential cons as well. One potential downside is that you may need to invest more time and effort into learning how to use the technology and customize your website, as opposed to using a pre-built website builder or template. Additionally, you may need to pay for hosting and maintenance costs if you are using your own server.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your website can be a cost-effective and customizable solution for your business, but it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons and potential costs before making a decision.

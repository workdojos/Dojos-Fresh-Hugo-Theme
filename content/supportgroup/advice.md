First of all, it is important to understand what the role of a moderator in the support group industry entails. Moderators are responsible for facilitating and managing online or in-person support groups for individuals with a specific need or issue. They often work with people dealing with mental health issues, addiction, or other challenges.

Based on your skills, interests, and experience, it appears that you have strong communication and interpersonal skills, as well as a desire to help others. These are important qualities for a moderator to possess. Additionally, your previous experience working in customer service or a similar field has likely helped you develop patience and problem-solving skills, which are also essential for this role.

In terms of job market trends, the demand for support group moderators is likely to continue growing as the importance of mental health support becomes more widely recognized. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for online support groups, which may be a growing area for moderators to focus on.

To pursue a career as a moderator, it would be helpful to obtain a bachelor's degree in social work, psychology, or a related field. This can provide you with the necessary knowledge and skills to work effectively with individuals facing challenging circumstances. Additionally, obtaining a certification in mental health or addiction counseling can be beneficial, as it can help you specialize in a specific area of support group work.

Overall, it seems that a career as a moderator in the support group industry would be a good fit for you based on your skills, interests, and experience. With the right education and qualifications, you can make a positive impact on the lives of others and contribute to the growing field of support group work.

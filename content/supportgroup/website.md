As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few key reasons. Firstly, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization of your website. This means you can tailor the design and functionality of your website to meet the specific needs and goals of your business. Additionally, open-source technology typically has a large community of developers and users who contribute to its development and support, resulting in a more stable and reliable platform.

There are several popular open-source web builders and static-site generators that can be used to create a website for your business as a moderator working in the support group industry. Some examples include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which are all widely used and have a large range of themes and plugins available. Static-site generators like Gatsby and Hugo are also popular choices for creating fast and lightweight websites that can be easily deployed on your own server.

In terms of pros and cons, using open-source technology for your website can be cost-effective as there are often no licensing fees associated with using these tools. However, it is important to consider the resources and time required to set up and maintain your website using open-source technology. Additionally, you may need to pay for premium themes or plugins if you want to use more advanced features on your website.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your own website can be a great way to achieve a high-quality and customizable website for your business, as long as you are willing to invest the time and resources required to set it up and maintain it.

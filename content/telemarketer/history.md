The word "telemarketer" was coined in the 1970s, when telemarketing (the practice of using telephone calls to sell products or services) was in its infancy. The term combines "tele-" (from the Greek word "tÄ“le," meaning "far off") with "marketer" (a person who promotes or sells products or services).

The practice of telemarketing itself can be traced back to the early 20th century, when businesses began using telephone surveys to gather information about potential customers. However, it was not until the 1970s that telemarketing became a widespread practice for direct sales.

The meaning of the word "telemarketer" has remained largely unchanged over time, referring to a person who makes sales or marketing calls over the phone. The meaning of "telemarketing" has also remained consistent, referring to the practice of using telephone calls to sell products or services. However, the negative connotations of telemarketing have increased in recent years due to the prevalence of unwanted or unsolicited sales calls.

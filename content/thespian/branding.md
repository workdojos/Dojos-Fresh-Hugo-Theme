Sure, I would be happy to help manage the presence of your performing arts organization on social media. Here are some suggestions for how I would approach this task:

Develop a content calendar: In order to consistently update your social media channels and engage with your audience, it's important to have a clear plan for what types of content you will post and when. This could include promoting upcoming performances, sharing behind-the-scenes glimpses of your organization, showcasing the work of your artists, and more.

Engage with your audience: Social media is a two-way conversation, so it's important to actively respond to questions, comments, and messages from your followers. This helps build a sense of community and can also help generate new leads and conversions.

Use hashtags: Hashtags can help you reach a wider audience on social media, so be sure to use relevant hashtags when posting content. This could include hashtags related to the performing arts industry, your city or region, or specific performance themes.

Collaborate with others: One way to increase brand awareness and reach a new audience is to collaborate with other organizations or individuals in the performing arts industry. This could include cross-promotion on social media, joint events or performances, or guest appearances by artists from other organizations.

Use analytics to measure success: It's important to track the success of your social media efforts, so be sure to use analytics tools to measure the reach and engagement of your posts. This can help you identify what types of content are most effective and where you can improve.

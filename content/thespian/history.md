The word "thespian" comes from the ancient Greek word "thespis," which referred to a poet or actor in Greek theater. The word "thespis" was later adopted into Latin as "thespius," which was eventually shortened to "thespian" in English. The word "thespian" originally referred to any actor, but now it is more commonly used to refer specifically to an actor in theater or the performing arts.

The term "performing arts" refers to the various forms of artistic expression that involve a live performance in front of an audience. This includes theater, dance, music, and other forms of entertainment. The term "performing arts" has its roots in the Latin phrase "ars scenica," which means "the art of the stage." This phrase was later shortened to "performing arts" in English. The meaning of the term has remained relatively unchanged over time, although it has come to encompass a wider range of artistic disciplines.

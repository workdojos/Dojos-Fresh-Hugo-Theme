First and foremost, being a thespian allows you to express yourself creatively and share your talents with the world. It's an incredibly fulfilling career that allows you to truly make a difference in the lives of others through your performances.

Another perk is the opportunity to travel and see new places. Many thespians get the chance to tour with productions, allowing them to see different parts of the world and experience different cultures.

In addition, working in the performing arts industry can also be very lucrative. Many thespians are able to make a good living through their performances, and there is always room for growth and advancement within the industry.

According to recent data, the industry is expected to continue growing and expanding in the coming years, making it a great time to jump in and start your career as a thespian.

As for helpful websites, I would recommend checking out The Actor's center (https://www.theactorscenter.org/) for resources and information on the industry, as well as The Actors Fund (https://www.actorsfund.org/) for support and assistance for those working in the industry.

And finally, don't forget to keep a positive and excited attitude about your career as a thespian! Believe in yourself and your abilities, and always stay motivated and driven to succeed. With hard work and dedication, you can achieve your goals and have a successful and fulfilling career in the performing arts industry. So, keep up the good work and never give up on your dreams!

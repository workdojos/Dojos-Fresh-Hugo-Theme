As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for several reasons. Firstly, open-source technology is free to use, which can greatly reduce the overall cost of building and maintaining a website. Secondly, open-source technology is constantly being updated and improved upon by a community of developers, which means that your website will have access to the latest and most advanced features and technologies. Additionally, using open-source technology allows you to have complete control over the design and functionality of your website, which can be especially important for a thespian working in the performing arts industry where a professional and visually appealing website is essential for promoting your work.

Some of the leading open-source web builders that you could consider using include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms are user-friendly and offer a wide range of customizable templates, themes, and plugins that can help you build a professional-grade website quickly and easily. Static-site generators, such as Gatsby and Next.js, are also popular options for building a website and offer fast performance and easy deployment. Other open-source apps that you might consider using include tools for SEO, analytics, and marketing, such as Google Analytics, Yoast SEO, and Mailchimp.

Overall, the main pros of using open-source technology to build your own website include the cost savings, access to the latest and most advanced features, and the ability to fully customize the design and functionality of your website. Some potential cons to consider include the need to have some technical skills or hire a developer to build and maintain the website, as well as the potential for security vulnerabilities if the website is not properly maintained. It is important to carefully weigh the pros and cons and consider your budget and technical capabilities before deciding on the best open-source technology for your business website.

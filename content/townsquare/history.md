Business owner:

The word "business" is derived from the Old French word "businesse," which means "affair" or "trade." It ultimately comes from the Latin word "negotium," which means "work" or "business." The word "owner," on the other hand, is derived from the Old English word "gēra," which means "master" or "lord." It ultimately comes from the Proto-Germanic word "auzō," which means "farmer" or "owner."

The term "business owner" originally referred to someone who owned a business or trade, and was responsible for managing and overseeing the affairs of that business. However, over time, the meaning of the term has broadened to include anyone who owns or operates a business, regardless of their specific role or responsibilities within the company.

Tourism:

The word "tourism" is derived from the Latin word "tours," which means "circle" or "turn." It ultimately comes from the Proto-Indo-European word "ter," which means "to cross." The word was first used in the early 19th century to describe the act of traveling for pleasure, and was coined by the French writer Auguste Viatte.

In its original sense, tourism referred to the act of traveling for leisure or pleasure, with the goal of experiencing new cultures, landscapes, and activities. However, over time, the meaning of the word has broadened to include any travel that is not strictly for work or essential purposes, including travel for education, adventure, and other personal reasons.

Sure, here are some ideas for an engaging campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest to promote your new business in the tourism industry:

Instagram: Create a series of eye-catching photos showcasing your business and the destinations you offer. Use hashtags related to tourism, travel, and your specific business and location to reach a wider audience. Engage with followers by asking them to share their own travel photos and using Instagram stories to take them on virtual tours of your business.

Twitter: Tweet about your business and the destinations you offer, using hashtags and tagging relevant accounts to reach a larger audience. Share interesting facts, travel tips, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of your business to keep followers engaged. Use Twitter polls to ask followers for their input on travel plans and destinations.

YouTube: Create a YouTube channel featuring videos of your business and the destinations you offer. Share travel vlogs, virtual tours, and destination guides to give followers a better sense of what your business has to offer. Use YouTube's community tab to interact with followers and answer their questions about travel.

Pinterest: Create boards featuring travel inspiration and destinations, with pins linking back to your website and social media accounts. Share pins of your own business and destinations, as well as relevant content from other sources. Engage with followers by repinning their content and commenting on their pins.

Overall, the key to an engaging campaign is to share high-quality content that showcases your business and the destinations you offer, and to interact with followers on a regular basis. By using hashtags and tagging relevant accounts, you can reach a wider audience and drive traffic to your website and social media accounts.

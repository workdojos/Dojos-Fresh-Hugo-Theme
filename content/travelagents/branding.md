Sure, I would be happy to help manage your travel & tours organization's presence on Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. Here are some ideas for campaigns and strategies I would recommend:

Share travel tips and inspiration: Share photos and videos of your tours, as well as travel tips and inspiration to encourage people to book a tour with your organization.

Collaborate with other travel & tours organizations: Reach out to other travel & tours organizations and see if you can collaborate on social media campaigns or cross-promote each other's content.

Utilize hashtags: Use relevant hashtags such as #travel, #tourism, and #adventure to increase the reach of your content and attract new followers.

Offer special promotions and discounts: Use social media to offer special promotions and discounts to your followers, encouraging them to book a tour with you.

Respond to questions and comments: Monitor your social media accounts regularly and respond to questions and comments from your followers to create a positive customer experience and build trust with your audience.

Measure success with analytics: Use analytics tools such as Twitter Analytics, Instagram Insights, and Pinterest Analytics to track the success of your campaigns and see what's working and what needs improvement.

Create engaging content: Use a variety of content formats such as photos, videos, and written posts to keep your followers engaged and coming back for more.

Overall, I would focus on building a strong presence on social media through consistent, engaging content and active community management. This will help increase brand awareness, recruit followers, drive traffic to your website, and ultimately lead to increased conversions.

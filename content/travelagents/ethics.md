As a philosopher, one way to approach this question would be to consider different ethical theories and how they might apply to the situation of starting a career as a travel agent.

One ethical theory that could be relevant is deontology, which holds that actions should be guided by moral duties or rules. In the context of starting a career as a travel agent, this might mean considering one's duty to act with honesty and integrity, to provide accurate and reliable information to clients, and to prioritize the safety and well-being of travelers.

Another relevant ethical theory is utilitarianism, which holds that actions should be guided by the principle of maximizing overall happiness or well-being. In the context of starting a career as a travel agent, this might involve considering the potential consequences of one's actions on all parties involved, such as clients, travel companies, and destinations.

A third ethical theory to consider is virtue ethics, which holds that actions should be guided by the virtues or character traits of the agent. In the context of starting a career as a travel agent, this might mean developing virtues such as kindness, empathy, and professionalism in order to effectively serve and meet the needs of clients.

Ultimately, developing an ethical framework for starting a career as a travel agent will likely involve a combination of these different approaches and a careful consideration of one's own values and goals. It may also involve seeking guidance from industry professionals and codes of ethics, as well as seeking to stay informed about relevant legal and regulatory considerations.

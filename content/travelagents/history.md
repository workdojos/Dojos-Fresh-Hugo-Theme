The word "travel" is believed to have originated from the Old French word "travail," which means "work" or "toil." It is thought to have come from the Latin word "tripalium," which refers to a torture device used to punish slaves. The word "travel" originally referred to the labor and effort involved in going on a journey.

The word "agent" is derived from the Latin word "agens," which means "a doer." It originally referred to someone who acted on behalf of someone else, such as a representative or messenger.

The phrase "travel agent" is a combination of these two words, referring to someone who acts on behalf of a traveler to plan and arrange their journey. The profession of travel agent has likely been around for centuries, as there has always been a need for people to help plan and book transportation and accommodation for travelers.

The phrase "travel and tours" refers to the business of organizing and offering guided tours and vacations for travelers. This phrase likely originated in the 20th century, as the tourism industry began to expand and become more organized. The term "tours" comes from the Old French word "tour," which means "a round." It originally referred to a journey or expedition that involved going around or visiting different places.

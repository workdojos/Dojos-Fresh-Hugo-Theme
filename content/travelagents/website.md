As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for several reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization. You can modify the code to fit your specific needs and preferences, rather than being limited to the pre-designed templates and features of proprietary software. This can be especially beneficial for a travel agency, as you may want to include specific booking and itinerary features that are tailored to your business.

Second, open-source technology is often more cost-effective. Many open-source web builders and static-site generators are free to use, while proprietary software often requires a subscription or licensing fee. This can be a significant cost-saving for a small business like a travel agency.

Third, open-source technology is generally more secure. Because the code is open for anyone to review and contribute to, any vulnerabilities or bugs are likely to be quickly identified and addressed. This can give you peace of mind and protect your business from potential security breaches.

There are several leading open-source web builders and static-site generators that I would recommend for creating a website for a travel agency, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and customization options, and are easy to use even for those with limited coding experience.

In terms of open-source apps that can enhance the overall user experience, some options to consider include calendar and booking plugins, social media integrations, and responsive design to ensure that the website looks and functions well on all devices.

While there are certainly benefits to using open-source technology, it's important to also consider the potential drawbacks. One potential con is that open-source software may not have the same level of support and resources as proprietary software. However, there are typically active online communities and forums where you can find support and guidance for any issues you may encounter.

Overall, I believe that using open-source technology to build your website as a travel agency can be a cost-effective and customizable option that enhances user experience and meets your business goals.

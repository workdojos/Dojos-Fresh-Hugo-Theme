As a philosopher, I would recommend beginning with a foundation in moral and ethical theories. This could include studying the works of philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and his concept of the "categorical imperative," which states that we should act in ways that we would want to see universally adopted, or John Rawls and his theory of justice as fairness, which suggests that the most just society is one in which the least advantaged members are as well-off as possible.

In addition to these foundational theories, it may be useful to consider the specific duties and responsibilities of a trustee in the fiduciary and security services industry. This could involve researching industry regulations and best practices, as well as considering the impact of one's actions on clients and stakeholders.

One approach to developing an ethical framework for this career path could be to prioritize the principle of beneficence, which requires acting in the best interests of those one serves. This could involve actively seeking to protect the assets and interests of clients, and ensuring that one's actions are transparent and accountable.

It may also be important to consider the principle of non-maleficence, which requires avoiding causing harm to others. This could involve avoiding conflicts of interest and acting with integrity in all decisions and actions.

Ultimately, the development of an ethical framework for this career path will require a careful balancing of these and other moral and ethical considerations, as well as a commitment to ongoing self-reflection and improvement.

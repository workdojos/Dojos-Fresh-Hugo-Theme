The word "trustee" is derived from the Old French word "trost√©" which means "protector" or "guardian." It was originally used in the legal sense to refer to a person who was responsible for managing the property of another person or entity.

The word "fiduciary" is derived from the Latin word "fiducia" which means "trust" or "confidence." It was originally used to describe a person who holds a position of trust or confidence, such as a lawyer or financial advisor.

The phrase "security services" is a more modern term that refers to the various services that are designed to protect individuals, businesses, or governments from threats such as crime, espionage, or terrorism. The origins of this phrase are somewhat difficult to trace, as it likely emerged as a result of the increasing need for security in a rapidly changing world.

Over time, the meanings of both "trustee" and "fiduciary" have remained largely unchanged, although they are now commonly used in a variety of legal and financial contexts. The phrase "security services" has also gained widespread usage as a term to describe a variety of services related to security and protection.

Sure, I can definitely help with that. Here are some suggestions for campaigns that we could run on Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest:

Twitter:
Tweet out industry news and updates related to labor relations, as well as your organization's own news and updates.
Engage with other labor relations organizations, influencers, and experts by retweeting their content and joining in on relevant conversations.
Run a Twitter Q&A with a leader or expert from your organization, encouraging followers to ask questions and engage with your team.
Use hashtags related to labor relations, such as #LaborRights, #WorkplaceEquality, and #UnionStrong, to increase the visibility of your tweets.
Instagram:
Share visually appealing content that showcases your organization's work and values, such as photos and videos of your team, events, and campaigns.
Utilize Instagram Stories to share behind-the-scenes glimpses of your organization and to engage with followers in a more casual way.
Collaborate with influencers or other organizations in the labor relations industry by featuring them in your posts and asking them to share your content with their followers.
Pinterest:
Create boards featuring resources, articles, and infographics related to labor relations and workplace equality.
Pin images that showcase your organization's work and values, such as photos and videos of your team, events, and campaigns.
Utilize Pinterest's promoted pins feature to increase the visibility of your content and drive traffic to your website.
In addition to these campaigns, I would also recommend regularly monitoring and responding to comments and questions on all three platforms, using analytics to track the success of your campaigns, and updating your content regularly to keep your followers engaged.

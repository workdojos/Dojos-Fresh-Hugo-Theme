As a union organizer working in the labor relations industry, it is my belief that fair work practices are essential for the well-being and prosperity of workers. In recent years, there have been numerous trends and events that demonstrate the importance of fighting for workers' rights and ensuring that they receive fair treatment and proper wages.

One trend that has been particularly concerning is the growing income inequality in the United States. According to data from the Economic Policy Institute, the top 1% of earners in the country saw their wages increase by 3.7% between 1979 and 2017, while the bottom 90% only saw an increase of 0.2%. This widening gap between the rich and the rest of the population has serious implications for workers, as it means that they are increasingly unable to afford basic necessities like housing, healthcare, and education.

Another trend that has been causing concern is the decline of union membership in the United States. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership has been steadily declining since the 1950s, with the rate falling from a high of 35% in 1954 to just 10.5% in 2018. This decline in union membership has been linked to the erosion of worker protections and the decline in wages and benefits for many workers.

In recent years, there have also been numerous events that demonstrate the importance of fighting for fair work practices. For example, the fight for a $15 minimum wage has been a hot topic in the media, with many workers and advocates arguing that the current minimum wage is simply not enough to live on. Similarly, the #MeToo movement has brought attention to the widespread problem of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace, highlighting the need for stronger protections for workers.

As a union organizer, it is my belief that workers deserve fair treatment, proper wages, and strong protections against discrimination and harassment. I believe that unions play a vital role in advocating for these rights, and I will continue to work towards a more equitable and just society for all workers.

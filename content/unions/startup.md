Idea Name: Union Connect

One Liner: A digital platform connecting union organizers with workers seeking to unionize and advocating for their rights.

Target User Persona: Union organizers and workers seeking to unionize in the labor relations industry.

User's Pain Points to Solve: Difficulty in organizing and communicating with a dispersed group of workers, lack of resources and support for unionization efforts, and challenges in negotiating with management.

Main Value Propositions: Union Connect provides a central platform for union organizers to easily connect with and communicate with workers, access resources and support for unionization efforts, and negotiate with management through a secure and organized platform.

Sales & Marketing Channels: Union Connect will primarily market through targeted social media advertising and partnerships with existing union organizations and labor advocacy groups. The platform will also offer paid subscriptions for premium features and resources.

Revenue Stream Sources: Subscription fees, advertising partnerships.

Cost Structures: Development and maintenance of the platform, marketing and advertising expenses.

Key Activities: Developing and maintaining the platform, marketing and advertising efforts, partnerships with union organizations and labor advocacy groups.

Key Resources: A team of developers and designers to create and maintain the platform, marketing and advertising budget.

Key Partners: Union organizations and labor advocacy groups.

Idea Validation Steps: Conduct market research to assess the need and demand for such a platform within the labor relations industry, conduct user testing with potential target users to gather feedback and assess usability, and gather input from union organizers and labor advocacy groups to ensure the platform meets their needs and addresses their pain points.

Estimated 1st Year Cost of Operation: $200,000-$300,000

Potential Business Challenges: Competition with existing union organizing platforms and resources, challenges in acquiring and retaining subscribers, and navigating complex labor laws and regulations.

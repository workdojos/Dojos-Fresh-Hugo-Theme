As a web design consultant, I recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons. First and foremost, open-source technology allows you to have complete control over the development and design of your website. This means that you can customize the look and feel of your site to match your brand and business goals, rather than being limited by the templates and features offered by proprietary platforms.

In addition to the customization benefits, open-source technology is often more cost-effective than proprietary platforms. While there may be upfront costs associated with building and hosting your own website, the long-term cost savings can be significant.

There are many open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other popular open-source apps available for creating a website. Some of the leading options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and customization options, making them suitable for a variety of business needs.

One potential drawback to using open-source technology is that it may require more technical expertise to set up and maintain. However, there are a number of resources available to help you get started, including online tutorials and forums.

Overall, the benefits of using open-source technology to build your own website far outweigh the potential drawbacks. If you are willing to invest the time and resources into building and maintaining your own site, the long-term cost savings and control over the design and development of your site make it a highly attractive option.

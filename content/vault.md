Wait until you hear that running your Bitwarden server only uses up a fraction of the computing power available to you with your Work Dojo!
{{% title3 "Why Vaultwarden?" %}}
It's basically a mirror image ("fork") of the popular Bitwarden app. It has the same exact functionality.  And it's virtually free once you have a working server up and running.

Premium plans with Bitwarden are still a worthy (and wise) option.  Self-hosting does not include backups, unless you make backups yourself at the server level.  If you're a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants kind of guy, then certainly self-host and deal.  For others, go with their paid pan, $3.33/mo per user is a very reasonable cost.

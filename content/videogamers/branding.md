As the social media manager for this video game organization, I will start by creating a content calendar to ensure that we are consistently posting relevant and engaging content on all three platforms. This will include a mix of promotional material, behind-the-scenes glimpses, and industry news.

On Twitter, we will engage with our followers by asking for their opinions on new releases, hosting giveaways, and participating in relevant Twitter chats. We will also use hashtags to reach a wider audience and potentially collaborate with other video game organizations.

On Instagram, we will use visually appealing content such as graphics, GIFs, and video to showcase our brand and games. We will also utilize Instagram Stories to give a more authentic and personal look into our company culture.

On Pinterest, we will create boards featuring our games, as well as inspiration for gamers such as home gaming setups and gift ideas. We will also collaborate with other users and organizations in the video game industry by repinning their content and collaborating on boards.

We will use community management tools to monitor conversations and respond to questions and comments in a timely manner. We will also regularly check analytics to measure the success of our campaigns and make any necessary adjustments.

Overall, our goal is to increase brand awareness, recruit followers, drive traffic to our website, and potentially make opportunities for collaboration with others in the video game industry through our presence on Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest.

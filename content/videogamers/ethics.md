As a philosopher, I would approach this topic by first considering what ethical principles are most important in the context of the video game industry. Some possible values to consider might include honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, and transparency.

Next, I would consider how these values might be applied in the context of starting a career as a gamer. For example, honesty might be important in terms of ensuring that players are not misled about the content or mechanics of a game. Fairness might be important in terms of ensuring that all players have an equal opportunity to succeed and that the game is not biased in favor of certain players or groups. Respect might be important in terms of treating all players with dignity and not using derogatory language or behavior. Responsibility might be important in terms of being accountable for one's actions as a gamer and making sure that one's behavior does not harm others. Transparency might be important in terms of being open and honest about one's motivations and intentions as a gamer.

To develop a comprehensive ethical framework for starting a career as a gamer, I would also consider other factors such as the potential impact of one's actions on the wider gaming community, the role of the gaming industry in shaping societal attitudes and values, and the potential impact of gaming on individual players and society as a whole. Ultimately, the goal would be to create a framework that guides one's actions as a gamer in a way that is consistent with one's values and that takes into account the potential consequences of those actions for others.

The word "gamer" is thought to have originated in the early 1980s, when video games were becoming more popular and people were starting to play them more frequently. The word is a combination of "game" and the suffix "-er," which is used to denote someone who does something. So, a gamer is simply someone who plays games.

The word "video game" is a bit more complex. It is derived from the Latin word "videre," which means "to see." This word was later combined with the word "game" to form "video game," which refers to a game that is played on a screen, typically using some sort of controller or joystick.

Over time, the meanings of both of these words have evolved. For example, the term "gamer" is now often used to refer specifically to someone who plays video games, although it can still be used to refer to anyone who plays any type of game. Similarly, the term "video game" has come to encompass a wide range of electronic games, from simple mobile games to complex, immersive virtual reality experiences.

The video game industry has exploded in popularity over the past few decades, with billions of dollars in revenue generated each year. While many big companies dominate the market, there is a growing need for open-source technology to serve the industry.

Open-source technology allows for more collaboration and innovation within the industry, as developers can build upon and improve upon existing technology rather than starting from scratch. This can lead to more efficient and cost-effective development, as well as a wider range of options for gamers.

For gamers, open-source technology can also provide more opportunities to get involved in the industry. With the ability to contribute to and develop games, gamers can not only enjoy playing, but also have a hand in creating their own experiences. This can lead to a more fulfilling and exciting hobby, as well as potential career opportunities.

Small businesses also stand to benefit from the use of open-source technology in the video game industry. With the ability to create and sell games without the financial burden of large budgets and resources, small businesses have the potential to thrive in the market. This not only benefits the businesses themselves, but also helps to create a thriving economy by providing more opportunities for employment and growth.

In conclusion, the video game industry should embrace open-source technology to facilitate collaboration, innovation, and opportunities for gamers and small businesses. It is important for the industry to recognize the value of these factors in order to continue thriving in the future.

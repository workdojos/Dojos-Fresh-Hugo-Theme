Influencer: The word "influencer" first appeared in the English language in the late 19th century, derived from the Latin word "influens," which means "having an influence." Initially, it referred to people who had a strong influence on the opinions or actions of others, often through their persuasive words or actions.

In the modern age, the term "influencer" has taken on a new meaning, specifically in the realm of social media. Now, an influencer is typically defined as a person who has a large following on social media platforms and uses that platform to promote products or ideas to their followers. The influence of an influencer is often measured by their number of followers, engagement, and reach.

Social media: The term "social media" was first coined in the early 2000s, with the rise of websites and apps that allowed users to create and share content with others. It is derived from the words "social" and "media," which refer to the interactive and communal nature of these platforms.

Initially, social media was used primarily as a way for people to connect with friends and family, share news and information, and share photos and videos. However, as social media platforms have grown in popularity, they have also become powerful marketing tools, allowing businesses and influencers to reach a large audience and promote their products or ideas. The meaning of the term "social media" has evolved over time to encompass a wide range of platforms, including social networking sites, video sharing sites, and blogging platforms.

As a career counselor, it is my job to help you determine what careers are most suited for you based on your skills, interests, and experience. From what you have told me, it sounds like you are interested in pursuing a potential career as a web designer working in the digital services industry.

First of all, let's take a look at your skills and experience. It's important to consider whether you have the necessary skills and experience to be successful in this field. Some key skills that are important for web designers include:

Proficiency in design software such as Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.)
Strong attention to detail
Excellent problem-solving skills
Ability to work well under tight deadlines
Strong communication skills
Based on what you have told me, it sounds like you may have some of these skills already. If you feel like you are lacking in any areas, it may be beneficial to consider taking some courses or workshops to further develop your skills.

Now let's take a look at the job market trends in the digital services industry. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of web designers is expected to grow 8% from 2019 to 2029, which is faster than the average for all occupations. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for businesses to have an online presence, as well as the increasing use of mobile devices.

In terms of qualifications, it is generally helpful to have a bachelor's degree in a related field such as graphic design, computer science, or web development. However, it is not always necessary to have a formal education in order to become a web designer. Many successful web designers have learned their skills through self-study and on-the-job experience.

Overall, it sounds like a career as a web designer in the digital services industry could be a good fit for you based on your skills and interests. I recommend conducting further research into the specific tasks and responsibilities of this role, as well as the specific requirements and qualifications that may be required by different employers. Additionally, it may be helpful to reach out to professionals currently working in this field to get their perspective and advice. Good luck in your career search!

As a philosopher, I would approach this question by first considering the ethical principles that are relevant to the digital services industry. This might include principles such as respect for privacy, transparency, and responsibility.

Next, I would consider how these principles can be applied to the specific role of a web designer. For example, a web designer has a responsibility to ensure that websites they design and build are secure and protect the privacy of users. They should also consider the impact of their work on society, and ensure that it is not used for harmful purposes.

To further develop an ethical framework for starting a career as a web designer, I might also consider the broader social and cultural context in which web design takes place. This could involve considering the impact of web design on issues such as inequality, social justice, and the environment.

Ultimately, an ethical framework for a web designer should be guided by a commitment to creating positive change in the world through their work. This might involve designing websites that empower users, promote social justice, or protect the environment. It might also involve considering the ethical implications of different design choices and actively working to create a more ethical and responsible digital world.

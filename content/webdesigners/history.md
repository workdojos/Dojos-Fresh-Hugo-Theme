Web designer:

The term "web designer" refers to someone who is responsible for the design and layout of a website. The word "web" comes from the Old English word "webbe," which means "woven fabric." The word "designer" comes from the Latin "designare," which means "to mark out."

The concept of web design as a profession emerged in the 1990s, with the development of the World Wide Web. At that time, web designers were responsible for creating and maintaining websites for businesses and organizations.

Over time, the role of a web designer has evolved to include a wide range of responsibilities, including the design and development of responsive websites, the creation of user interfaces, and the use of various programming languages and technologies.

Digital services:

The term "digital services" refers to services that are provided or delivered through digital means, such as the internet or other computer networks. The word "digital" comes from the Latin "digitus," which means "finger." This refers to the use of digits, or numbers, to represent information in a digital format.

The concept of digital services has become increasingly important in recent years, with the widespread adoption of the internet and the growth of the digital economy. Digital services can include a wide range of activities, such as online shopping, banking, and entertainment.

Over time, the meaning of the term "digital services" has evolved to include not only services that are provided through digital means, but also services that are enabled by digital technology, such as data analytics, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.

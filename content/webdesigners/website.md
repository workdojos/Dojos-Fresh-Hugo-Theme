As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your own website for a few key reasons:

Cost: One of the biggest benefits of using open-source technology is that it is often free to use. This can be a huge advantage for small businesses or startups that may not have a large budget for website development.

Customization: With open-source technology, you have the ability to fully customize your website to fit your specific business needs. This allows you to create a unique and personalized user experience for your customers.

Community support: Open-source projects often have a large community of developers and users who can offer support and guidance when you run into issues. This can be a valuable resource when building your website.

Some popular open-source web builders that you might consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. These platforms offer a wide range of features and tools for building and managing a website, and have strong communities of users and developers who can offer support.

Static-site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, are another option for building a website. These tools allow you to create a website using simple HTML and CSS, and can be particularly useful for building small, lightweight websites.

Other popular open-source apps that you might consider using to enhance your website include email marketing tools (such as Mailchimp), content management systems (such as WordPress), and e-commerce platforms (such as Magento).

Overall, the main pros of using open-source technology to build your website include cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and community support. However, it's important to note that open-source technology may require more technical knowledge and resources to set up and maintain, so it may not be the best fit for everyone. Additionally, you will need to host the website on your own server, which can come with additional costs and responsibilities. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of open-source technology before deciding whether it is the right fit for your business.

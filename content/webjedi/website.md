As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a few key reasons.

First, open-source technology allows for greater flexibility and customization. With access to the source code, you can make changes and modifications to the website as needed to better fit the needs of your business and your target audience. This is particularly important in the digital marketing services industry, where you may need to make frequent updates and adjustments to your website to stay competitive.

Second, open-source technology is often more cost-effective than proprietary options. While there may be upfront costs associated with setting up and maintaining an open-source website, these costs are often lower than the ongoing fees associated with using proprietary software. Additionally, open-source options often have a larger community of developers and users, which means that you may have access to a greater range of resources and support.

In terms of specific open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other apps, some popular options to consider include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal for content management systems, Gatsby and Jekyll for static-site generators, and tools like GitHub and GitLab for version control. It's important to carefully research and consider the pros and cons of each option to determine the best fit for your business.

Overall, open-source technology can be a great choice for building and maintaining a website in the digital marketing services industry, providing the flexibility and customization you need to meet the needs of your business and your target audience.

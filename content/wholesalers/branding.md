As a social media manager, I would begin by creating a content calendar for the wholesale organization's presence on Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. This calendar would outline the types of content that will be shared on each platform, as well as the frequency of posting.

Next, I would focus on building the organization's follower base on each platform. This could be done through tactics such as running promotional campaigns to recruit followers, participating in relevant Twitter chats and Pinterest group boards, and collaborating with other wholesale industry influencers and organizations.

To increase traffic to the organization's website and drive conversions, I would include calls to action in social media posts and encourage followers to visit the website for more information. I would also track the success of these efforts using analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to measure the impact of social media campaigns on website traffic and conversions.

In addition to creating engaging content and updating regularly, I would also be sure to engage with the audience by responding to questions and comments in a timely and professional manner. This could include answering customer inquiries, thanking followers for their support, and promoting relevant content from other industry sources.

Overall, as a social media manager, my goal would be to effectively manage the presence of the wholesale organization on social media platforms in order to increase brand awareness, recruit followers, drive traffic to the website, and drive conversions, as well as create opportunities for collaboration with others in the wholesale industry.

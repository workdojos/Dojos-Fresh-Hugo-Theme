The word "wholesaler" comes from the Old English word "hwhol," meaning "whole." It was originally used to refer to a person who sold goods in bulk, or in their entirety, rather than in smaller quantities. The word "wholesale" also comes from the Old English word "hwhol," and refers to the sale of goods in bulk or large quantities.

The word "wholesaler" first appeared in English in the early 16th century, and was used to refer to a person who sold goods in bulk to other merchants. The word "wholesale" also appeared in the early 16th century, and was used to describe the sale of goods in large quantities to merchants or other buyers.

The meanings of these words have remained relatively unchanged over time. However, in modern usage, the term "wholesaler" may also refer to a company that sells goods in bulk to other businesses, rather than just an individual seller. The term "wholesale" may also be used to describe the sale of goods in bulk to consumers, rather than just to other businesses.

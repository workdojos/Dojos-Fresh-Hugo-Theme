Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Here are some ideas for an engaging social media campaign on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest to promote your new wholesale business:

Instagram: Share photos and videos of your products, highlighting their unique features and benefits. Use hashtags related to your industry and encourage followers to tag their friends in the comments section. Consider hosting a giveaway or contest to drive engagement and increase brand visibility.

Twitter: Tweet about new products and updates related to your business, and interact with your followers by replying to their comments and questions. Use hashtags and participate in relevant Twitter chats to reach a wider audience.

YouTube: Create a series of educational videos about your products and how to use them. Share tips and tricks for using your products effectively, and consider offering behind-the-scenes looks at your business operations.

Pinterest: Pin images of your products, along with ideas for how to use them in different settings. Create boards related to your industry and pin related content to them as well. Consider hosting a Pinterest contest or collaborating with other influencers in your industry.

Overall, the key to a successful social media campaign is to create engaging content that resonates with your target audience and encourages them to take action (e.g. following your account, purchasing your products, etc.). Good luck with your new business!

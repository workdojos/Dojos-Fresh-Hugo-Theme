As a web design consultant, I would recommend using open-source technology to build your website for a number of reasons. One of the main benefits is cost - open-source technology is often free to use, which can be a significant advantage for small businesses or those operating on a tight budget. Additionally, open-source technology is constantly being updated and improved by a community of developers, which means that you will have access to a wide range of features and functionality without the need to pay for additional licenses or subscriptions.

There are a number of popular open-source web builders, static-site generators, and other apps that can be used to create a professional and effective website for your wholesale business. Some of the leading options include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, which offer a range of templates, themes, and plugins that can be customized to meet your specific needs. Other popular open-source options include static-site generators like Gatsby and Next.js, which can be used to create fast and lightweight websites that are easy to maintain and scale.

There are also some potential drawbacks to using open-source technology, including the fact that it may require more technical expertise to set up and maintain a website, and that you may not have access to the same level of support as you would with a proprietary platform. However, the cost savings and flexibility of open-source technology can often outweigh these potential drawbacks.

In terms of costs, the use of open-source technology can significantly reduce the overall cost of building and maintaining a website, as you will not need to pay for licenses or subscriptions. However, you may still need to pay for hosting, domain registration, and any additional plugins or themes that you choose to use. It is important to carefully consider all of these costs and compare them to the cost of using a proprietary platform before making a decision.

Overall, using open-source technology to build your website can be a cost-effective and flexible solution that can help you create a professional and effective online presence for your wholesale business. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons, as well as the costs, of each option before making a decision.
